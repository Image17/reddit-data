funny	Reaver_XIX	It makes sense to me to be allowed buy in bulk. The argument here is that it prevents suicide. But if I wanted to all I need to do is go to different shops and pharmacies and 1 box in each. It is so bad in fact people have died from anaphylaxis because the pharmacy wouldn't give them an epi-pen without a prescription! Not at all sure why stuff like epi-pen or asthma inhaler should be over the counter. But different countries have different rules some better than others.	-3

funny	Buttgoast	"While they play the same sport, the severity of the data collection is on another magnitude. In addition, Google is only one of many keeping an eye on you as you troddle through the interwebs.

Installed that app from the app store? Well then, guess you just signed off access for Google to track your location even if the app isn't running. 

Visited a website? You think those ""Like"" buttons on the websites are for users to share content? If you see one of them on a website, you might've as well gone straight to facebook.c\*m. They'll track you even if you don't use their services, or better yet, explicitly disagreed to their terms and services, usually under the guise of ""security"" or ""personalization"". There's plenty more hidden as tracking pixels and other trickery where you don't see it. 

While Google does have a fairly clean record, other companies aren't quite as friendly. Facebook in particular has been under some fire for selling their data to whoever might wave a wad of cash in front of them. And even if they keep in completely inhouse, that's still thousands of people with access to the data. Government agencies can also access the data and there's always the (inevitable) issue of leaks and hackers. 

Yes, grocery stores might track you in the store, but they don't install cameras on your body to keep an eye on you when you go home. They don't also let other companies install cameras on their property or on their customers."	2

2. If you knew *anything* about law and were not another know-it-all pissant, you'd know that in the vast majority of cases defense attorneys don't provide evidence, and are often in their strongest position when they don't.

3. As to your opinions on my skills, see point 1.

On a side note, it endlessly fascinates me why you little trolls do this. And by this, I mean argue things you know nothing about, with the people who do. Its bizarre. It seems to be one of the defining traits of reddit. I've seen morons argue physics with physicists, medicine with doctors, etc.

How do you not see how moronic that is?

Let me put this a different way. You know how all of reddit like to rag on anti-vaxxers and feel really enlightened because of it? And you know how one of the main points is that it is ridiculous that these people argue science and medicine with scientists and doctors, and when they're backed into a corner, attack people's qualifications and skills?

That's you.

That's what you do. And you probably do it to people all the time.

funny	Droyk	"There are also other hacks to make it appealing as possible:

* Burgers in ads are raw and covered in shoe polish.
* When they need to photograph an insect, they put them in the fridge first so they don't move.
* To make the cereal float on top of the milk, they pour some Elmer's glue in the milk.
* Deodorant spray is used to make fruits look shiny.
* Ice creams in ads are just mashed potatoes with food colouring.
* Antacid can also be used to make drinks look foamy. 
* Sauce is just melted, coloured wax. 
* Glycerin is used to make seafood look fresh.

Though in some countries, a lot of this is out of date. some of my friends have experience with the advertising of food, and the laws changed. So most of this is not true anymore, although it used to be. At one point watered down latex paint was used for ""splash"" shots of cereal. But laws were passed that all products in food shots needed to be edible. So the paint was replaced by a flour, oil and water mixture. The laws were changed again that food shots had to use the food being represented. So now milk is usually milk with some sort of thickener added.

I ended up burying the egg in a tiny grave in the corner of the yard. Strange thing is, years later when I was 21, I had this REALLY vivid dream of this birdy-y lizard-y thing with a big scaly frill telling me it was the creature that was inside the egg and that it's name was Christopher. It then took me to meet a dog man, who told me it was my dog Jesse, who told me my dad gave him to this guy when we moved interstate and that guy ended up shooting him. I woke up BALLING. I drew what I saw (the cockatrice dude and dog man) and decided to call dad, and asked him if Jesse got shot. He confirmed that, yes, Jesse did indeed get shot by the guy he had given him too. This 100% true. But I rationalise it as my brain already knew that Jesse was a cunt of a dog and getting shot was always on the cards."	-4

In a physical fight size fucking matters as well as being able bodied.  A gun levels that shit out fast and allows more people to effectively protect themselves.  Guns are very dangerous, but anything that allows you to effectively physically protect yourself has to be.  This extends to protection from the government if needed.  Granted the government will win against small groups, but the hope is that the government treads lightly because of the risk.	4

Three or four times when I came home from school and started climbing down the mountain in the valley house was in (this is in Tasmania, so you gotta picture it kinda like Hobbits live there and shit), I looked down the slope and into backyard of the house to see what the dogs were doing (i had this mad half dingo dog that used to pick me up from school most days and escaped from the pound TWICE and made his own way home, once bringing a German Shepard puppy) and I saw Stephen running around chasing Jesse (that was the dog's name, after John Stamos' character in Full House) and jumping on top of him to get short little rides before jumping up into the air as high as he could. Kinda like he was flying for a little. Like he used to.

While working on Mondo Media, Rhode Montijo drew on a piece of scrap paper a character who would later become Shifty. He then drew on a spreadsheet poster a yellow rabbit that bore some resemblance to Cuddles and wrote ""Resistance is futile"" underneath it. Rhode hung the drawing up in his workstation so other people could see his idea, and eventually the idea was pitched to and accepted by the Mondo Media executives."	0

In your mind watching two men have sex, isn’t gay porn *so long* so it’s just someone that’s drawn them right?

And secondly, if this doesn’t qualify as child porn simply because it’s been drawn, why does it qualify as porn at all? Why do people find it sexually exciting if it’s got nothing to do with sex at all? Or is it just more convenient to argue that it being hand drawn makes certain aspects of it okay? 

Ultimately the only argument that has any weight here is that it doesn’t have any *Victims* which, while a good thing, doesn’t escape from the fact it’s still alarming people are drawing it in the first place, let alone the fact some people are consuming it in sexual fashion."	4

* In the advertising world most food is uncooked so it retains volume and Form.
* Burgers in ads are raw and covered in shoe polish.
* When they need to photograph an insect, they put them in the fridge first so they don't move.
* To make the cereal float on top of the milk, they pour some Elmer's glue in the milk.
* Deodorant spray is used to make fruits look shiny.
* Ice creams in ads are just mashed potatoes with food colouring.
* Antacid can also be used to make drinks look foamy. 
* Sauce is just melted, coloured wax. 
* Glycerin is used to make seafood look fresh.

Though in some countries, a lot of this is out of date. some of my friends have experience with the advertising of food, and the laws changed. So most of this is not true anymore, although it used to be. At one point watered down latex paint was used for ""splash"" shots of cereal. But laws were passed that all products in food shots needed to be edible. So the paint was replaced by a flour, oil and water mixture. The laws were changed again that food shots had to use the food being represented. So now milk is usually milk with some sort of thickener added.

funny	CanisMajoris85	Captures 360, and you can upload that 360 video to YouTube directly to view, or you can use an app on your phone/Computer to manually control what you want to edit into a rectangular 16:9 video (also can do square or 9:16). So if all the action was to your right you could just pan over to the action and capture just that. The entire 360 video takes up a lot of storage so it's good to just manually capture what you want to see since that drastically reduces file size. On your phone you can turn your phone during playback of the 360 video to see wherever you want, so if you physically spun 180 degrees you could see what the camera captured behind you. Can also just flick with your finger.	5

The whole story line is based on one or two twists? Is that why spoilers are so hated? 

Movies these days suck. The last time I was excited about a movie enough to pay for the theater experience was clerks 2. You could tell me everything that happens in that movie and it wouldn’t spoil it. Even with dick and fart jokes, movies used to have substance. You didn’t need 2 hours of action with 3 giant plot twists that the whole movie depends on. You could enjoy the writing, acting.

I have chronic pain from a few things. For me personally, Tylenol doesn't do anything. Advils usually work far better.

However, what you can see is that rape has apparently started to increase in Sweden. What you don't see is that the stats are merged together before and after a law amendment was made such that every separate count of rape in one case counts every single instance of rape occurred. For example, if a woman is in an abusive relationship and raped 100 times and then report it to the police, the statistics will increase the rape count by 100. In any other country this counts as a single incident. Furthermore, the new law includes if you are committing indecent exposure, this counts as rape in Sweden. Molesting counts as rape. Literally everything like that is amassed into one statistic called rape. About 70% of the cases in Sweden that's classified as rape would not be classified as rape in other countries. That means that 30% of the cases you see in recent data is penetrative rape and attempted penetrative rape.

Furthermore, the numbers of reported rapes in Sweden is almost on par with perceived rape in society, while in countries like Japan, about 95% of victims don't report their offenders because they're afraid. Sweden takes their crime victims seriously, and numbers show that Swedish people have more trust in their police than most countries, which is one of the factors why so many rape victims (or any other victim of crime) aren't afraid to report the crimes they've suffered.

But this of course doesn't fit your agenda, so it's much more convenient to ignore the facts and follow your feelings instead, right?"	-52

So if all the action was to your right you could just pan over to the action and capture just that. The entire 360 video takes up a lot of storage so it's good to just digitally edit and capture what you want to see since that drastically reduces file size. On your phone you can turn your phone during playback of the 360 video to see wherever you want, so if you physically spun 180 degrees you could see what the camera captured behind you. Can also just flick with your finger.

Video quality is never going to be as good as a true 4k camera, as it's more comparable to like 720p since a 360 4k or 5.7k camera is capturing every direction. But useful when you don't know where something will happen."	14

funny	DeadFyre	"> While they play the same sport, the severity of the data collection is on another magnitude. In addition, Google is only one of many keeping an eye on you as you troddle through the interwebs.

True, but now we're talking about competence and capability, rather than the fundamental nature and purpose of the activity. Fundamentally what the 'Internet Privacy' cranks want is privacy in public, which is absurd when you actually think about it.

> Visited a website? You think those ""Like"" buttons on the websites are for users to share content? If you see one of them on a website, you might've as well gone straight to facebook.c*m. They'll track you even if you don't use their services, or better yet, explicitly disagreed to their terms and services, usually under the guise of ""security"" or ""personalization"". There's plenty more hidden as tracking pixels and other trickery where you don't see it.

Yeah, I'm a network engineer and I help run a public-facing website, so there's very little you can tell me about how the system works. But at the end of the day, they know what you told them, either directly or indirectly. What Internet privacy regs  want to do is coerce web companies to a higher standard than any brick and mortar business, in so far as the requirement is to selectively forget about interactions you've had with them. In what real-world brick and mortar business would it be reasonable for a customer to walk up to the manager's desk, and ask them to go back and erase every transaction they've conducted, and every recording they'e made of them?

> While Google does have a fairly clean record, other companies aren't quite as friendly. Facebook in particular has been under some fire for selling their data to whoever might wave a wad of cash in front of them. And even if they keep in completely inhouse, that's still thousands of people with access to the data. Government agencies can also access the data and there's always the (inevitable) issue of leaks and hackers.

True, but if for some reason Kroger got an offer to sell their CCTV footage of customers for a princely sum of money, do you think for a moment they wouldn't do it? Do you imagine Kroger is any less vulnerable to being hacked, being a relatively unsophisticated non-technical company?

> Yes, grocery stores might track you in the store, but they don't install cameras on your body to keep an eye on you when you go home. They don't also let other companies install cameras on their property or on their customers.

Yes, but this analogy doesn't hold up. The cookie tracking only works when you visit another website with the same tracking cookie. Same with tracking pixels. Cookies are domain-limited, so effectively what you're doing is visiting multiple businesses whose closed-circuit cameras are operated by the same outsourcing company.

Look, the fact is, it is not **possible** to provide access to a website to anyone without knowing something about the client. If I don't know your IP address, I can't send you your traffic. If you're browsing my catalog, I have to know what categories you're looking at.

I won't deny that there are very real rogue actors, and very real risks on the internet. Facebook may in fact be one of those rogue actors (I don't think so, I just think they're dumb, and their business model is fundamentally one that monetizes user surveillance). But the regulation that has passed in aid of the supposed goal of making the Internet safer has gone about their work in what seems to me to be the most ineffective and disingenuous manner possible. Right now, this very minute, there's scads of free software you can download which carries real malicious software. Just go to Sourceforce or CNET and download *anything*, and then say 'yes' to all the things they suggest. Congratulations, you've now installed your very own private stalker. Neither the EU, nor the US have decided to do squat about that. Instead, they've insisted on inserting another piece of meaningless boilerplate in front of literally every website, warning you that you're being tracked. There are thousands upon thousands of malicious hackers running bot networks and infecting user machines incessantly. Among my other duties, I run our firewall. The volume of spurious traffic generated by malicious robots prying at my front door beggars the imagination, but nobody in any government is actually doing anything about **THAT**. Instead, they're (not really) protecting us from the ""danger"" of user-tracking and (not really) preventing Google remembering what flavor cookies you buy in the snack aisle. How about doing something about the outfits bundling the virus-infected garbage which festoons everyone's parents' and grandparents' computers? Nope! Gotta make sure Google doesn't steal your eye teeth because they know what you told them."	-10

On top of that, what checks would there be to ensure that the people issuing this mental check would not abuse that power and declare mentally fit people as unfit because they don't like guns? If a woman needs antidepressants for postpartum, must she forfeit all rights to her guns? Do the cops hold them or is she forced to get rid of them forever? What about people who aren't using drugs but just go to therapy?

A typical NRA member has not been to an annual meeting, not given money past their membership level, and probably only have a connection to a few of the more prominent mouthpieces of the NRA that are also typically more reasonable than the NRA itself.  Many want to get rid of the problem in the NRA the Vice President, which the current president tried to do but was ousted for the attempt.	6

funny	scamsthescammers	"I was sexually interested in girls WAY before I was ""of age"" or they were ""of age"".

When I was 12, like this guy, these girls were about 15 and I didn't see ""cutish girls"". I saw hot girls I wanted to have sex with. Hell, I was sexually attracted to girls my age who were *younger* than the Olson Twins and didn't even finish puberty, yet.

Also: You do realize puberty exists for a reason, right? You do realize that the entire point of puberty is to become sexually attractive to the opposite gender and attracted to them?

It's hilarious that some people's repressed sexual attraction to young people leads to them living in denial of basic human sexuality and child sexuality. Yes, ""children"" are sexually attracted to other ""children"" and some arbitrary .

You think people genuinely think ""wow, I would never touch that girl with a ten foot pole, she looks like a child, disgusting"" one day and suddenly go ""wow, what a hottie!"" the next based on some magical age line where they suddenly turn from ""innocent child"" to ""hot"" the moment they blow out the candles on their birthday cake? Get a grip.

The only reason I'm not attracted to young girls anymore is because *they are fucking annoying*. From a physical perspective, girls are *objectively physically sexually attractive* after they underwent puberty. That's literally the biological function of puberty. Living in total denial of basic facts about sexuality and repressing them will not magically change how human beings are wired on average. People who objectify women and genuinely only care about looks probably also don't care about age and only see a girl who underwent puberty, which is - biologically speaking - ""hot"".

>I guess money obviously

You probably guessed correctly.

Or, you know, they enjoyed the attention because they - like everyone else - are sexual beings. I certainly would have encouraged women sexualizing me when I was a teenager. I also probably would have had sex with anyone who had asked me. Unfortunately, nobody asked me."	18

This would still be strange to me even if it did prevent extremely rare events. I don't think it makes sense to legislate based an outliers. I guess you could save FAR more innocent lives by lowering your speed limits to 60kph in all zones. Sure, it'd be a HUGE inconvenience but what about the children that get killed in car accidents all over the country. Isn't it selfish to want to get somewhere a few minutes earlier if you could be literally saving lives by slowing down! Across countries, violence is closely related to income inequality, not weapons ownership. Look it up if you don't believe me. You're literally giving up liberty without gaining security.

funny	Seated_Heats	"I mean, you'd really have to get detailed as to what the situation is.  Do I know, for a fact that this person means no harm to me or my family?  If there's the slightest shred of doubt in my mind that the intruder may threaten or actually injure my child or wife, then I think I would shoot them.  If I was absolutely certain they were just taking my TV, then I'd probably not shoot them.  

That's a tough thing to really say for sure when not in the situation and having time to process the information.  In the actual situation, judgement may be reached quicker.  In the end, if it was a guarantee that they were just taking something and leaving, I'd like to not shoot them, but in that moment, you don't know, and my family means too much to me to take a risk.

Edit:  Fully honest, I don't want to shoot anyone, although breaking into someone's home is also a form of terrorizing a family.  Sure, you're not actively terrorizing them, but the feeling of not being safe in your home, and the feeling of being violated by having a stranger walking around in your home without being invited is terrifying.  Even if the thief is ""just"" stealing an object, they're also stealing a family's sense of safety.  My parents had a friend whose house was broken into and their kid was probably 6 or 7 and his personality markedly changed after that.  He became timid and shy.  It's not ""just"" stealing your shit."	-6

Giving a warning reveals your position, and gives the intruder time to either find cover or potentially even shoot you first. 

And also unlike movies, people don't instantly die the second a bullet touches them. By giving away your position, you give the intruder the opportunity to shoot at you even after you've shot him and he's on the ground.

Long story short - while ideal from a theoretical perspective, a verbal warning is completely unreasonable from a practical perspective.

There were thousands of people walking all around and there I was, just sitting on a step, eating my sandwich. Then, straight out the sky, a seagull dove down and snapped his beak onto the sandwich I was holding in my hand just a few feet from my face. He managed to pull the sandwich from my grip but also lost the rest of it as he flew away so it fell to the ground but there was a perfect beak-shaped cut out from the sandwich, it looked like a damn cartoon. My family laughed hysterically at me as I spent the next 30 min tracking that seagulls flight and whereabouts and repeatedly attempting to hit it with my shoe.	-1

funny	ArcadiaNisus	"It's nearly impossible to tell that someone doesn't have a weapon on them. The smallest functional guns are around the size of half your thumb. Some of the most concealable can fit in your wallet or easily within the palm of your hand.

During a home invasion it's more about addressing/understating their intent. If they know you're home and haven't ran than they most likely know a confrontation is possible and are ready for it. Which is why the one guy said he would rack his gun. Hopefully they hear it and run.

An alternative approach is to pick a room and guard it quietly without alerting them while they do their thing and hope they don't come that far onto your house. For instance in my house you could steal more than you could ever carry and still walk away without ever even coming upstairs.

If you aren't concerned with protecting your family, your house, and your belongings, then I would recommend grabbing your firearm and escaping out a window or back door, running to a nearby safe location and shooting yourself there."	3

There are so many factors to this, the chain-ification of pharmacy is one, as is the fast-paced nature of modern medical billing. The fact that doctors basically have to cram patients in every single day to guarantee they make a profit combined with the sheer number of people who DEMAND medication for whatever ails them makes pharmacist-doctor interaction almost impossible nowadays. The most I've ever spoken to a doctor in the last year was when I was threatening to report one to the DEA as a pill mill for prescribing wildly outrageous amounts of opiates.	-1

They're easily $600-1100 and that's not including the camera are all the spare parts you require to get decent enjoyment out of the RC vehicle. You can spend $300 on one, but you get what you pay for. And it's impossible to tell how fast that truggy can potentially go because the person driving it never goes WOT for more than a second or two. He's driving on grass (which significantly slows the vehicle). The operator could also be using a throttle profile on his TX to avoid going past e.g 70% throttle.	0

If someone is breaking into your home then you likely don't know what their state of mind is.

Having a weapon at the ready to defend yourself doesn't imply you are just going to use it immediately for lethal purposes.

The odds might be higher in some places that a break-in is happening because of drunken confusion. It would be unfortunate if a non-violent intruder ended up injured or dead because of their own drunken mistake. Regardless, their drinking habits and mistakes aren't the responsibility of the homeowner. 

The homeowner should not feel obligated to accept the risk of being unarmed during a violent home invasion because it would be better circumstances for a non-violent confused drunk who was breaking in. It's not the homeowner's responsibility to look out for the life and safety of the drunk. That is the drunk's responsibility."	-12

It tried to fly and land on a road with lots of cars driving by. It kept  trying to pick the corpse up. At one point it picked up some intestines and pulled up a bit.

He cited Darwin in *Das Kapital* and studiously analyzed the failure of the Paris Commune so that future revolutions would be more successful.

It makes no sense to me to say ""a person from a weaker class can do anything they want to a person from a more powerful class."" Aside from the fact that we've all belong to a lot of different classes (does a working-class white bricklayer get to firebomb the black CEO of American Express?), this just doesn't cut the mustard. Murder, rape, theft, acts of interpersonal violence, assault, etc., are not justified no matter who is doing them to whom. Somebody needs an excuse or a justification (like imminent self-defense or necessity) to justify any actions that facially fall into any of these categories. And the classes that people belong to do not make a difference here. You don't get to steal from your employer, slash your bosses tires, or firebomb your landlord just because you think they're a jerk and they belong to a more powerful class so its OK."	-8
philosophy	CaesarVariable	"If you think you can comment on Marx's beliefs based just on the Manifesto, then woo boy do you have a long way to go.

Marx and Engels jointly defined the state as arising in order for one class to oppress another. Whether or not that statement is correct is neither here nor there for now - what is important is that this is the interpretation used within Marxism. Therefore, if the endgoal of socialism is to eradicate all classes except the proletariat, then the state would have no purpose anymore - as there would be no class to oppress. That is why Marx predicted the state would wither away.

The point Marx is making in the quoted passage isn't that the state would still exist but lose it's political character. Keep in mind the Communist Manifesto was as much a rebuke of other socialist theories as it was advocating Marx's interpretation. What he's saying is that authorities and hierarchies will still exist - but not political ones."	3

Without these morals than all of humanity would be in anarchy like those canibalistic tribes that still live in the primal ages because they can't advance as a society.

The fact that morality is universal and commonly understood has been accepted for hundred of years now. The debate is about where we derive that morality from.

I think I am getting the point but my problem remains: his standard is too vague. It's susceptible allowing anyone to justify all kinds of horrible acts ""because class power relations."" This allows people to justify anything they want with vague allusions to context and class power relations.

The langue people speak as opposed to borrowed abstractions from Greek and Latin. That's English in our case. Could be Chinese in another. I don't know the extent of Latin influence on non-Romance languages but in English, words borrowed from Greek and Latin (at least academic words) just muddy things up.

>And what do you mean nouns and verbs are the best way to communicate? Do you struggle with adjectives and adverbs despite using a few in that paragraph?

I don't need to work backwards to shit on the ideas, I just need to put them in English to expose how stupid they are. 

One of my favorite tales as a child was ""The Emperor Has No Clothes."" I think it's a wonderful metaphor for how vapid Marxist ideas are and how they get a veneer of being intellectual when they're cloaked in jargon and argot. That goes ditto for most forms of academic discourse. It's an attempt by some people to feel more clever than others through the use of fancy words -- whether or not the ideas are justified is secondary.

I study the psychology/neuroscience of performance and effort and a core issue in the field is distinguishing between failure due to, as she puts it, ""involuntariness in actions"" versus ""scoundrelism"". 

However, her other relevant point that we should somehow jettison the ""moral ought"" (while retaining some other kind of ought?) I find confusing. Perhaps someone can help me understand as I find no basis for using terms like ""ought"" in psychology except for use in a moral context of personal beliefs. Hume's is-ought problem gets at the heart of my dilemma: on what scientific grounds can ought EVER be used? Anscombe seems to think Hume didn't realize the profundity and power of questioning this simple folk-psychological principal. To me it seemed obvious upon my first reading of Hume that his goal was to demonstrate that all is-ought (or is-owe, etc) connections require some deeper mutual assumption or faith -- a kind of assumption that has no place in our modern conception of science. Between a customer and merchant they move from ""is"" to ""owe"" under their commonly held beliefs about an overarching civil law that applies to both of them. Without this how could there ever be a natural/scientific is-owe connection for them? But then one of them may ask themselves why they should believe in that civil law and we are right back to the core is-ought issue. Either someone believes in the law because it will benefit them in a real way or out of some kind of faith (some duty as a ""citizen"", religious belief, etc). With civil law, fear of punishment provides an extreme boundary that helps nudge their cost-benefit analysis toward upholding that law -- this provides the ""is"" (you DO steal - you ARE punished) if a moral ""ought"" cannot be found. 

For animals we only have the perceived cost and benefit information to guide our ""conscience"". Where is there room for any kind of natural/scientific ought in any context?"	11

Its one of the major reasons why marxist thought sucks.


 In analysing potential structural expressions of humanity at its worse: - greed, violence, abuse - Marxism started to believe those expressions alone are responsible for human greed, abuse, violence.

 Marx is great for understanding some of the negatives and failures of his era.  His solutions are junk...because he took too much faith in his ability to reason:  he solved a whole bunch of complex problems...on paper.  No real world testing.

philosophy	AncntMrinr	"\> The price of data storage is going up

That is a lie. Storage has been getting cheaper for literal years. Both in terms of server-grade storage and in terms of personal storage. All the way back in 2012 the highest date a laptop could have while staying within the reach of the average consumer was a couple hundred gigabytes, but now you can get laptops with 2TB harddrives at the entry level. [Google's cloud storage launched with 5GB of storage free, with 100GB costing $50 a month, and now we have 15GB free and 100GB is $10 a month](https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/24/2971025/google-drive-official-launch-features). For comparison, I could fit almost 50,000 books into Google's free cloud storage.

&#x200B;

\> The cost to run a library as opposed to a server farm is a tortoise/hare situation with a huge upfront cost to have the physical library, but a minimal upkeep

Another lie. While the costs of a server *farm* is high, the individual cost of a *server* is very low. Whereas the cost of a library is in the millions annually, once factors such as land costs, employee wages and salaries and benefits, upkeep, electricity and water, etc, the cost of a text-based website is usually less than $100,000 a year. In addition, online libraries have the advantage of being able to service non-local populations.

\>  The great quote my stepmother gifted me, ""if there's a corner, I'm going to fill it."" There are similar problems with physical books, but the continuous costs is nothing compared to data.

&#x200B;

Cute quote, but ultimately wrong. Once you factor in the costs of the space used by the books, the price skyrockets. I could build a server for less than $300 USD off ebay, put a few 4 TB HDDs set in RAID for redundancy, and my total start up costs would be less than $600 USD and running year-to-year costs less than $200 in electricity.

For example, a Platonist has the responsibility of ascending their soul through rational contemplation (or in some cases theurgic ritual). This is a similar means of finding virtue within the quite contrary ontologies of Stoicism and Platonism.

Another example, and this one is tricky, is Epicureanism. Though the Epicurean has a responsibility to pleasure above all—they recognize rational discourse to be the greatest pleasure possible. In this case, the epicurean has a somewhat different means of finding virtue in a similar ontology to Stoicism; Namely, the smallness of our existence. 

Though I think that Stoicism is valuable in its utility for finding a level head, I think it is also important to understand exactly what gives it this quality. For example, we can use Similar personal direction as a Platonist, or if we can’t get over the incommensurability of our universe we can employ an epicurean outlook to live the best from what we have to begin with."	14

philosophy	RadicalZen	">The PoC population has never experience a police force accountable to justice for rampant abuse of violence.

I have no doubt that cops get away with a lot of shit and juries/grand juries are often too sympathetic to them and prosecutors are reluctant to bring charges. But that does NOT mean that every instance in which a cop uses lethal force against a non-white person is an unjustified homicide. Nor is it the case that cops never ever get held accountable -- remember James Van Dyke? 

Nor is it purely a racial issue, because cops kill too many innocent people (black, white, and otherwise) without facing any consequences: http://time.com/4404987/police-violence/

Ironically in the context of this discussion, the biggest reason that cops don't face scrutiny from the criminal justice system is... the political influence of the police union. If being a cop isn't a proletarian job than I don't know what is. 

Also, what does this have to do with the ""democratic right"" to trespass and seize someone else's property? Let's keep our eye on the ball here. The recent media fascination with white cops killing African-American men doesn't have anything to do with factory seizures."	-12

philosophy	RadicalZen	"> Marxists don’t glorify violence

I disagree with this assessment. This is based on personal experience, but in my view most of the people who describe themselves as Marxists (or fellow travelers) that I have met think that violence perpetrated in the name of their own case is not only justified but downright thrilling. Most Marxists (at least in the Anglo-American world) tend to be middle class or higher university-educated young men with Napoleon complexes. 

>but they don’t balk at using defensive violence for when the capitalist class inevitably uses violent force to defend their position of privilege.

Defending a ""position of privilege"" is so abstract that I have a very hard time believing that this can work as a justification for an act of violence. The classic defenses to admitted acts of violence in criminal law are things like self-defense where the defendant commits an act of violence with a reasonable belief that they are about to suffer death or serious bodily injury or necessity. Seizing another person's property doesn't fall into that category. 

>For example if workers occupy a factory and assert their democratic right to run it themselves, the boss calls in the police to start shooting people.

There's not a democratic right for a group of people to take another group of people's property through direct seizure. Imagine that another group of people comes along ten minutes later and asserts that they have a democratic right to run the factory instead -- are the previous workers justified in telling them ""sorry this belongs to us"" any more than the representative of the company was in telling the workers that they couldn't seize the plant? How about if they decide that they want to seize your personal residence instead -- how are you justified in telling them no? What about the firefighters' pension fund that is a major investor in the company that owns the plant?

If you want redistribution of wealth, do it through the democratic process. Don't do it through ""direct action"" that is indistinguishable from theft, trespassing, and petty violence. 

Beyond this, the cops cannot immediately begin shooting people. If they do so, they can face murder charges. Police need a justification for the use of deadly force; American juries are often sympathetic to police (though not always, see James Van Dyke) but the facts in many high-profile cases are often complicated -- if the cop starts firing immediately upon arriving at the scene, he's getting a murder charge and it doesn't sound like it's going to be a particularly tough case. Much more likely, the police will try to break the lockout and arrest people for trespassing. If there's any violent attempt to resist arrest, that's when violence might occur."	-28
philosophy	porcomaster	If you ever go to Brazil you might disagree on this, critical thinking is good and must be taught, problem is it's not being taught on university's and Scholl's, there is a huge politic biased being taught instead	0
philosophy	cecinestpaslarealite	"No. They are akin in some ways--but only in the way that various seriously-minded political thinkers often bond over castigating centrists. 

Anscombe's point is that the way morality is conceived of in modernity is generally empty as a concept, and not really coherent. 
Nietzsche also noticed this--and took advantage of the situation to just clear it all away, as it were, and replace it with the classic Nietzsche stuff (creation of values, the will-to-power, and all that). 

Anscombe, on the other hand, is encouraging a return to a substantive way of thinking about ethics--namely, a return to virtue ethics, which has its roots in Aristotle. She certainly was opposed to Nietzsche.

If you are more interested in this debate, slash the history of modern ethics (and Nietzsche's role in it), I highly recommend Alasdair MacIntyre's book *After Virtue*."	4

philosophy	Erno_Kuikka	"This is a good point and the probability of getting caught is certainly important consideration for a potential criminal. Both of them matter and I think the relative importance depends on the severity of punishment. If you could end up being tortured to death, then even a small risk of getting caught would be too much for most people. The price they'd have to pay is simply too much for any kind of potential gain. 3 months in prison for car theft (especially given how comfortable prisons are in western countries these days) is such a slight sentence that I highly doubt many criminals would be deterred by that even with a reasonable probability of being caught.

&#x200B;

These two factors are inseparably linked. When the probability of getting caught goes down, more serious punishment is needed to make the crime too risky and ultimately not worth it for the criminal. When the probability of getting caught goes up, even slighter punishment might be enough to deter the criminal. These considerations obviously also depend on the subjective importance of whatever the criminal tries to attain. In other words, how much risk he's willing to take for the crime.

&#x200B;

While I agree that the probability of getting caught also matters, I think you underestimate the importance of severe punishment as deterrent to crime. There is surely a statistical difference based on the severity of punishment. If one society gives a 3 month sentence for car theft and another gives 10 year sentence, I think it's obvious which society has less car thieves. Especially given that the probability of getting caught stays roughly the same with any type of crime."	-9

philosophy	comradeMaturin	"It means the means shape the end as much as the ends shape the means


Everyone thinks that it’s a one way relationship, that if the end is justified then the means are justified. But it’s a two way relationship that’s part of a never ending process. Today’s end becomes tomorrow’s means. For example, Trotsky uses industrial machinery. Workers and factories use the means of work to produce industrial machinery, the end, which in turn becomes the means of the next state of the process 


> A means can be justified only by its end. But the end in its turn needs to be justified. From the Marxist point of view, which expresses the historical interests of the proletariat, the end is justified if it leads to increasing the power of man over nature and to the abolition of the power of man over man.

...

> “Just the same,” the moralist continues to insist, “does it mean that in the class struggle against capitalists all means are permissible: lying, frame-up, betrayal, murder, and so on?” Permissible and obligatory are those and only those means, we answer, which unite the revolutionary proletariat, fill their hearts with irreconcilable hostility to oppression, teach them contempt for official morality and its democratic echoers, imbue them with consciousness of their own historic mission, raise their courage and spirit of self-sacrifice in the struggle. **Precisely from this it flows that not all means are permissible. When we say that the end justifies the means, then for us the conclusion follows that the great revolutionary end spurns those base means and ways which set one part of the working class against other parts, or attempt to make the masses happy without their participation; or lower the faith of the masses in themselves and their organization, replacing it by worship for the “leaders”.** Primarily and irreconcilably, revolutionary morality rejects servility in relation to the bourgeoisie and haughtiness in relation to the toilers, that is, those characteristics in which petty bourgeois pedants and moralists are thoroughly steeped.


> These criteria do not, of course, give a ready answer to the question as to what is permissible and what is not permissible in each separate case. There can be no such automatic answers. Problems of revolutionary morality are fused with the problems of revolutionary strategy and tactics. The living experience of the movement under the clarification of theory provides the correct answer to these problems.


What Trotsky is saying there is that the means shape our end. If for example our end goal is human liberation, we can’t choose means that reproduce oppression such as a top heavy bureaucratic party.

There has to be some kind of excuse or justification that justifies a homicide in the specific circumstances of the killing like imminent self-defense -- the discrepancy in power between workers and capitalists doesn't cut it by itself. Also, I can't think of any class-based argument that would justify a proletariat raping the daughter of a wealthy capitalist.

I agree with this. This would lead to a circular definition of punishment and thus there could be no unjust punishment by definition. I got the impression that the article equivocates precisely because it makes no difference between just or real punishment and actions that are called punishment but actually serve something entirely different such as oppressing people to maintain the current regime or whatever. The motives behind these actions are different. Therefore if the article wants to discuss motives behind our need to punish, then it must take this difference seriously. It doesn't seem to do that.

&#x200B;

Obviously punishment is not rightful simply because it's practiced somewhere. It can be based on wrong reasons or it can be too severe given the offense. Some punishments are more just than others and some are completely unfounded.

philosophy	Veritas_Certum	"Here are a few initial thoughts.

**Theological background**

Olly, like others who have commented on Yacob, fails to take into account his theological background.  Yacob tells us he spent ten years at a school to study the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures. He tells us he learned the interpretations of both foreign Catholic scholars, and the interpretations of Ethiopian Coptic scholars.

This means Yacob would have had a comprehensive knowledge of earlier Christian thought and commentary on the Bible. He would certainly have been familiar with the writings of famous and influential early Christian writers and leaders who were born in North Africa, such as Tertullian and Cyprian in Carthage, Cyril, Origen, and Athanasius in Alexandria of Egypt, and Augustine in Numidia.

Yacob's personal approach to understanding God and nature was deeply influenced by these sources, and even though he made great efforts to scrutinize critically the Christian teachings he had learned, and explicitly rejected some of them, it is still possible to detect a Christian foundation in his thoughts, and even some of the conclusions he represents as his original thought, can be found in the writings of earlier Christian scholars he would have read and studied. Consequently, sometimes Yacob is reproducing his Christian theological heritage even when he imagines he is actually thinking independently.

Additionally, when Yacob comments on Judaism, he comments as an outsider. When he does so, it's clear that he doesn't actually understand what he's criticizing; he's viewing Judaism through a medieval Christian lens, and judges it according to his own theological norms. He perceives contradictions in Judaism which do not actually exist in Judaism; the contradictions are phantoms of Yacob's own Christian theology.

**Socio-cultural background**

Olly depicts Yacob as concerned with European colonialism and theft. Here's a direct quote from Olly.

>He mentions that the Europeans colonizing Africa were using their religion to cloak their theft, as an example of how it's important to think critically about what people tell you.

Yacob never actually says this. I think this is Olly reading his own concerns into Yacob's text. Many of us would assume that a seventeenth century African nation would necessarily have been less powerful and less influential than a European nation of the same era, and would therefore expect that Yacob and his fellow Ethiopians had been subordinated by the Portuguese.

However, this assumption would be very misguided. It is not true that African nations have always been subject to European conquest and colonization. In fact at various times in history, African nations, especially those in North Africa, were sufficiently powerful to raise empires and invade Europe, doing some conquering and colonizing of their own.

Yacob himself shows absolutely no concern for colonialism or theft by European powers. This is firstly because Ethiopia was not colonized by the Europeans, and the only Europeans who were visiting Ethiopia regularly at the time of Yacob (the Portuguese), visited as theologians and merchants who were at the mercy of the emperor of Ethiopia. They did not exert any significant influence on Ethiopia. In fact it was Ethiopia which sent a diplomatic envoy to Portugal, not the other way around.

Secondly, during Yacob's time Ethiopia was actually an empire. Over centuries, the Ethiopian empire had conquered several local kingdoms and brought many tribes under its rule. During the fifteenth century it sent diplomatic envoys to Europe, and became allied with Portugal. During Yacob's lifetime, he would have seen the Ethiopian emperor Fasilides demonstrate his dominance over the Europeans by re-establishing Coptic Christianity as the national religion, instead of Catholic Christianity, and commanding all Europeans to leave Ethiopia.

Yacob would therefore have viewed the Portuguese as social and political equals, not as imperial colonizers. Professor Chike Jeffers, who specializes in Africana philosophy, says ""Zera Yacob’s experience of Europeans was an experience of powerful outsiders but not of conquering or would-be conquering subjugators"". \[1\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[1\] ""Bentley’s point about the early modern world being before “industrial-strength imperialism” is apt here, as Zera Yacob’s experience of Europeans was an experience of powerful outsiders but not of conquering or would-be conquering subjugators (as compared with Ethiopians of the nineteenth century, who experienced a punitive expedition by the British and an attempted invasion by the Italians, or Ethiopians of the twentieth century, who experienced Italian occupation)."", Chike Jeffers, “Rights, Race, and the Beginnings of Modern Africana Philosophy,"" in The Routledge Companion to the Philosophy of Race, ed. Paul C. Taylor, Linda Martín Alcoff, and Luvell Anderson (Routledge, 2017), 130."	20
philosophy	SeaJay1994	So I read the article and this is what I think, we tend to overestimate the uniqueness of our thoughts and fail to recognize the impact of our surroundings on our thoughts.  In the article, it is clear that the author biasedly favors the Materialistic thought (I rather call it Empiricism),  and I do too, and I bet that you do too. Because statistically, if a person is posting here, on the internet, there is a good chance that the person was educated under an empirically based system, of course, there is Mathematics and such courses, but let's not make this post too long ok?  The point is, both of us live in a culture which thinks highly of empiricism.  And because of this, our opinion of which method is best used for arriving at a truth, or (what this author hardly tried to hide when asking) which is the inferior natural outlook we should overcome, and he already had overcame, is mostly circular self-validation, and completely and utterly biased.	7

Have you actually spent time in a philosophy department?

It is enlightening, if also scary, for someone left-leaning like me to read someone like Carl Schmitt (who was a nazi) and realize that some of the things he says makes a lot of sense. His attack on liberalism is important and powerful. There were probably more leftists in the department than classical conservatists, sure. But any of my teachers would have been insulted on their professionalism by the notion that they skimped on, or were hostile, in their presentations of right-wing ideology. Any academic philosopher would agree that their job is to understand and contextualize systems of thought, not offer a personal opinion on them (although they will probably gladly do so after hours, or after a few beers).

Yeah, fascism does tend to be unpopular in universities. If you have an ingrained desire to disguise excuses for oppressing people inside other unrelated philosophies, people who are even remotely competent in analysing arguments are going to see that and call you out.

It might actually be different if you made an open, and strong argument for why it might be necessary, but trying to get stuff past the radar on the quiet is generally going to be seen as not only oppressive but dishonest, and neither are desired in the workplace.

Maybe you had a bad experience in your course, or even the university itself, but that sure as hell does not transfer to all other universities. I can't think of an environment better for fostering critical thinking. Many are far from perfect, but to discredit the whole idea of universities because some have flaws is a bit too much. Also, this talk of controversial ideas questioning the status quo not taken seriously is often just a matter of fringe, badly formed ideas with little substance, which therefore are largely ignored because they just don't deserve great attention.	-8

> Lincoln’s significance lies in his not hesitating before the most severe means once they were found to be necessary in achieving a great historic aim posed by the development of a young nation. The question lies not even in which of the warring camps caused or itself suffered the greatest number of victims. History has different yardsticks for the cruelty of the Northerners and the cruelty of the Southerners in the Civil War. A slave-owner who through cunning and violence shackles a slave in chains, and a slave who through cunning or violence breaks the chains – let not the contemptible eunuchs tell us that they are equals before a court of morality!

While for some categories of statements we can have objective truth—e.g., it rained in my town yesterday—some statements cannot be objectively verified through common observations.  If statements such as person A killing person B is evil given circumstances C cannot be determined to be true through mere observation then they are determined using subjective judgment.  Another word for subjective judgement is opinion.  All values are opinion.  For a religious person, the individual opinions for values may be substituted by accepting a slate of values from one religion or another.  But because the correctness of that religion cannot be objectively verified, these values are still based on opinions.  To the believers, once the belief in the religion is a given then the further acceptance of these values is no longer opinion, but commandments.

Lots of people interpret his writings on stoicism to mean we must always be in complete control of our emotions and ignore the “bad” ones.

When, If you actually read and understand his writings, it’s all about controlling your reaction to emotions and delving into deep introspection to figure out WHY we feel a certain way.

philosophy	lividalux	"You say nature influences our desires.

I say our desires influence what nature even is.

You say desire leads to thoughts.

I say this is extremely far fetched. It does not seem to me to be the case that desire has any causal relation to thought itself. This is to resort to the  assertion of an identity of cogito that desires and thinks and Is. It is to assume ridiculously that there is first a separation between thought and desire and second a connection between the two rendering one of priority and the other of contingency or consequence... This is a massive leap... It is also to say that desire is somehow a part of something separate than what thought is a part of. This whole idea of desire -> thought -> emotion -> action -> conditioning is only atop a fallacy of misplaced concreteness. It is obvious that a person can act without thinking. It is obvious that people can and do act absurdly. It should be obvious that we are not mere robots a part of some deterministic simulation of conditioning. If this was the case then why would I be writing this right now? What origin in my 'nature' could possibly designate all of this? What origin in my 'nature' could possibly lead me to write poetry or consider philosophy, which is often full of angst and anxiety and contrary to what would be so utilitarian as consciousness operating as you say it does? I have seen this line of thinking before, and it still seems utterly superfluous. The only way it would make sense is atop the most massive leap of faith of reason there is, namely the Causa Prima, that fundamental postulate, that fundamental condition, that Beginning that everything has its origins in and derives its existence from... This is also the most absurd idea ever conceived. It shows up in many different forms.... It is called God. It is called instinct. It is called conditioning. It is called anything that makes one not responsible for existence; that makes something beyond oneself and/or all of humanity responsible. 

This conception is completely fatalistic and riddled with fallacies and errors. There is nothing that could logically substantiate the idea that habits have anything to do with what we feel emotionally. Whence cometh desire? This question itself is atop limiting presuppositions. Furthermore, there is absolutely no evidence in support of the idea that emotions have anything to do with some causal concatenation ontologically rooted in some 'nature.' Premising the individual as an object --- again presupposing the Cartesian identity of ego --- constantly acted upon (by what?) and which reacts and IS determined is to presuppose that something can indeed be determined! What is it exactly that is determined here? What can be determined must be something that is in itself something. This does not seem to be the case apropos of human existence. Change is the fundamental law of consciousness/existence. How could something that is never the same be considered to be something even capable of being apprehended by something outside of itself? Yes, the only way to explain this is by saying that consciousness is emergent and that the truth of it all originates in something that IS NOT, which could only have the ontology of an object, something nonconscious, nonphenomenal... The only way to explain away the profundity of existence is by first disavowing it. 

Saying freedom does not exist is of the same sort of thinking. If there is something determined then of course it is not free; however, there is nothing that is determined about consciousness other than its own determinations. There is nothing capable of being determined about it. There is no inside and outside. Furthermore, there is definitely no inside of subjectivity in the face of an objectivity that controls it. This is a problem of language. This is a snare of language. To speak of consciousness is to de facto designate it as something separate from what it in its 'truth' is. In other words, to speak of human existence is to a priori consider oneself as an object. 

Consciousness is not an object. Consciousness is furthermore always consciousness of something. There is no separation as if there was a consciousness that was not consciousness of something. And this something consciousness is consciousness of is never asunder from consciousness. There is no hidden reality of the objective that consciousness cannot ascertain or apprehend but which influences us and determines us. This is what Sartre calls bad faith; mistaking your facticity as limitation, objectifying yourself. 

""You are always aware that you are more than what you are aware of."" You are condemned to be free in that you must be free even if you are determined. Paradoxically, consciousness is the only barricade of freedom, because it is the origin of determinism and what would be to be in accordance with such a thing in the first place. Consciousness is not some passivity directed and directed. This is to dismiss responsibility. It is precisely radical responsibility that condemns us to freedom --- to be responsible for our own existence and what all of it entails... This is much harder and difficult than saying everything is predetermined. Freedom is a state of mind and it subsists in an acceptance/affirmation of responsibility. 

One cannot become responsible for themselves and their existence unless one affirms their own radical and complete freedom."	15

philosophy	crinnaursa	I'm not taking about experiencing or forcing grief. Working through it refers to the statement that I made about how grief is not actually an emotion but a collection of emotions that when separated  and identified can be dealt with individually. Grief is made out of emotions like guilt, personal loss, fear, feelings of abandonment, and so on.  Each of these, while overwhelming together, can be dealt with on their own by mastering  and reframing our response. For example loss can instead become gratitude for the time spent with a loved one. The stoic understands that it's not the events in our lives that cause us pain, but our perception of those events. Break up grief into it's smaller parts and change your perception of those and the total becomes totally transformed.	-2

philosophy	arikdondi	"I actually believe that we have free will but I don't believe that we need it, in order to be able to say that there are good or bad actions. Using the Greek myth of Oedipus as an example: It was predicted at his birth that he would kill his father and sleep with his mother. Even though steps were taken to prevent this from happening, it happens. When it does happen, he doesn't say ""it was fate, not my fault."" He gauges his eyes out and goes into exile. This is not an unintelligible or irrational course of action. We can completely understand the reasons why he would do that. He is taking (moral) responsibility for actions that were unspeakably bad, even though he didn't know that the actions he was taking were describable as ""killing his father and sleeping with his mother"" and he didn't choose to do them as such. Nonethelss having done them he understands that actions performed by him need atonement. I have written about this [here](http://www.arikdondi.com/2017/08/01/determinism-9-the-real-oedipus-complex-moral-responsibility-without-free-will/)."	-5

philosophy	arikdondi	Quantum mechanics doesn't have a great track record in illuminating questions around free will and determinism and I'm no physicist, but my understanding is that quantum mechanics wouldn't introduce complete randomness. Instead it would introduce things happening along the lines of statistical likelihood, rather than complete necessity.	3
philosophy	arikdondi	"I didn't say that things would happen completely by themselves while at the same time not being random. What I said is that there are situations in which there is potential for many things to happen but only one does. 

&#x200B;

So, there could be a situation in which necessary conditions are available for either x or y to happen, but not sufficient conditions. Whether x or y happens depends on whether the sufficient conditions for x or y first come into being. A human action, based on a human choice, creates the sufficient condition. At the same time the human action is an event caused by the conditions out there being as they are.

&#x200B;

No uncaused causes or events, no woo-woo stuff - just human choice. When you say we have never observed such a thing happening, you are just asserting something.

I truly believe that the wave finds balance, you must simply decide; to ride upon its eventual crests, fully aware  that you will drop into its inevitable troughs, or, to swim against the current. Given these choices, that solace I speak of is really only the knowledge that, either way you choose, you can count on the wave. In other words, one of the subtle wonders of reaching an impasse or having a breakthrough is realizing you have been there before, you just didn’t see it the last time."	4
philosophy	JLotts	One thing that I decided that was really helpful: the bad thoughts are symptoms of trying to resolve something, for the goodness of my perspective.

philosophy	Zapfrogart	"1.What is the Good Life?
- Living by whatever code or conduct that breads a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment that leave the world better than when you started. 

2.What is Justice?
- Seeing that everyone gets their due, good or bad.

3.What is Happiness?
- The feeling that comes of living a ""good life"" as stated above.

4.What should we do with our lives?
- Anything that we can to bring it in line with what we believe a ""good life"" is to be.

5.What makes someone a good learner?
- How much they listen and ask.

6.Is failure a good thing or a bad thing, why?
- Failure is the best teacher, so therefore good, but it does not feel good at first (exactly the same as exercise)

7.What is the most important part of learning?
- Becoming wiser.

8.Do you think that some people are born talented?
- Yes. We are all born with some degree of talent in some area... But talent is not as important as Mastery. Natural Talent may give you a head start, but only hard work brings you to Mastery.

9.Do you really know something if you can't remember it?
- Possibly. Instinctual devices can leave in the form of ""muscle memory"" things that you thought long forgotten (playing an instrument, tying knots, carpentry). It depends on HOW you are trying to remember something: if you sit alone in a dark room and simply try to bring something to memory, you may fail. But the very next day, you might walk thru a dance hall, with the smells of sweat and wood, and suddenly recall dance moves you hadn't thought of in decades. 

10.Are all smart people good test takers?
- Certainly not, because the definition is far too broad. You can have street smarts, and book smarts, and be smart at puzzles, or be smart with words. All of these are branches of logical and social thinking that have technical names, but few of them relate to something you could put on a multiple choice test administered by a standardized program in a school."	17

philosophy	PM_ME_NECROTIC_FLESH	"I've read the book but not seen the TV show. It is entertaining in its own way - Neil Gaiman is a skilled writer who seems to put a great deal of research into his work, which many find makes a compelling read. He is also occasionally guilty of something like the attitude you describe in your first response, an apparent need to demonstrate an openness to diversity that can subtract from the quality of his writing and feel somewhat patronising.

Most crucially, I think, for this discussion, is that he is not, nor trying to make grand statements. He is trying to write fantasy novels (and stories in other formats), and they are generally a cut above the average fantasy novel, but are far more about entertainment than enlightenment. The author here has I think put too much of his own views into his reading of Gaiman's work."	6
philosophy	Buddhamama50	"> Discipline, at least amongst my peers, is common, but eros is rare.

I am the exact opposite :) And I spend a lot of time in places like /r/relationships where people's lives are driven by eros and almost no self-reflection, let alone discipline.

And I completely agree with the idea that we need to modify and improve these ideas. Both Zen and Stoicism come to us from a time when life was short and very cruel. Many children died at a young age, which was heart-wrenching; and most people didn't live past 45. Under circumstances like these, Stoicism in the face of constant death and emotional distress was very helpful. 

In our modern life, Stoicism gives us a very useful path when dealing with distress. What it doesn't give us is a roadmap when dealing with apathy, or overwhelm (or apathy in the face of overwhelm); neither does it show us how to deal with joy - it was just assumed that if you felt joy it would be a brief burst in an otherwise fairly bleak existence and you should enjoy it while you could. 

I suppose the other thing to remember is that the Stoics were philosophers - thinkers - not particularly do-ers; so their responses to life were geared around thinking. Marcus Aurelius was a do-er, but *he was running the Roman Empire* one of the all-time shitty jobs in history. And yet he comes across as quietly joyful. He was doing a difficult job and trying to be a better person.

I turned to Buddhism, and then Stoicism, when I was completely overwhelmed by the demands of parenting two tiny children. What I was trying to deal with was not that overwhelm, but my irrational emotional responses to it. The fact that I was trying to parent two tiny children, with no help from anyone except my husband was the reason I was overwhelmed. Stoicism has no answer to that, because the causes are structural and societal. 

Although Stoicism makes a great argument for getting involved in the political life of a community, its a philosophy of individual control. Its not helpful for unpicking the reason for people's emotional distress in the first place. Its not a useful tool for dismantling social inequalities, or improving people's lives at a societal level. That's just not what it's *for*. Marcus Aurelius could have been a raging sociopath who believed that burning people alive was a good way to run the Roman Empire *and still be a good Stoic*.

>I'd argue I see fewer people who are capable of truly dancing than those who can sit at a desk, doing monotonous work for the good of their future.

And there's a good reason for this. Its because we *break* children, in the same way we break wild horses. We break them to sit quietly at a desk, to not ask difficult questions, to go along with everyone else, to do monotonous work, to ask permission for bodily functions, to fear failure, to line up quietly... It really is Foucault's monasteries, prisons, hospitals, factories, schools..... 

I homeschool my kids and one of the things that makes me roar with laughter is that homeschooled kids *can't line up*. We do parkour every week and the teacher was complaining that the homeschool classes don't know how to sit quietly on the mat, and don't know how to line up. 

They sit noisily on the mat, asking questions without putting their hands up first. They form clumps instead of lines. We had hot dogs at the end of term party and they formed a clump at the counter :) :) Amazingly though, everyone got a hot dog, there was no pushing and shoving, they all knew who's turn it was next, and the big kids allowed the little kids to get their hot dogs first....

But I digress. The point is that Stoicism won't reform our schooling system. A Principal may be a total despot, and yet still a good Stoic. Stoicism is for not getting swept away by despair, its not about reforming society wide systems and practices so that more people can feel joy. Stoic practices may help to sustain someone who is trying to do that, but I don't think it provides the moral framework to decide what a more joyful society would look like, or how it would function.

And that is its other problem - we have secularised it, because we live in a secular world. Its secularism is why I prefer it to Buddhism - not that I have a problem with Spirituality, but I disagree with Buddhist metaphysics. *But it was not a secular philosophy*. It talked a great deal about the Gods and what they expected of us. But because nobody worships the old Gods anymore, we've just excised that entire chunk of Stoicism, leaving it without that moral framework to operate from. So people interpose their own moral ideas, whether that's JudeoChristian, or ethical principles, or something else entirely. We can refer to the idea of ""human nature"" but that's not a moral framework either - we are capable of horrors, as well as great altruism, often springing from exactly the same set of basic biological drives.

Anyway, this conversation has given me something to chew over :) How could Stoicism be modified and improved to provide a moral framework for our society ? How could its principles and practices be extended to wider societal systems ? How could Stoicism lead to joy, rather than just better emotional control ? Is it capable of any of these things, or would that be extending it beyond its remit ?"	36

philosophy	PM_ME_NECROTIC_FLESH	The article has a similar patronising tone to it. It's not useful for many Americans to think of themselves as immigrants, because largely they aren't. They may be descended from immigrants, but so are the English in England; at some point it is no longer a useful label, because it blurs the useful distinction between established communities and more recent immigrants with a different experience, an experience usually shaped in part by interaction with those established communities. The author puts it in terms of a well-intentioned desire to build bridges between the established communities and more recent immigrants, but the reality is by trying to build a unified identity this way tends to lead to the majority drowning out the minority, so you can't help but feel they are at best naive, and at worst disingenuous.	9

>The power to influence or direct people’s behavior or the course of events

>If every action is a result of a predetermined chain of events, then you can’t influence the chain of events, as it was predetermined or utterly random.

The world being predetermined doesn't preclude us being able to influence behaviors or events. The shape of an object influences its trajectory as it's thrown through the air, even though that trajectory is wholly deterministic.

Even if it's absolutely guaranteed that event X will occur 10 days from now that doesn't mean we can't influence that event; it's perfectly possible that the event in question will have beeen the result of our actions; actions that we would have inevitably taken, sure, but inevitable doesn't mean without influence.

> Thus, none of your actions are actually morally good or bad as you have no actual choice in the matter, so modern conceptions of “justice” are stupid because we care so much about revenge when the perpetrator was a victim of circumstance. This is why prisons should only function as crime prevention and rehabilitation.

If everything is prederemined then there is no stupid or smart ideas, there are only thoughts that arise as a result of deterministic processes. If we have no control, meaning no ability to influence behaviors or events, then rehabilitation would be doomed to fail."	-12

It might be better for me to think through my anger. Consider what has made me angry, and if it really ought to have bothered me so much. If it's a person, did they mean to give offense? It may have been a mistake. If it wasn't a mistake, then I certainly have better things to do with my time than be angry at some fool. After all, I don't wander the streets and tell people they can do whatever they want with my body -- why should the same not be true for my emotions and my time? 

 If it was a mechanism or other non-agent, then it really doesn't help me to get angry at all -- it would be better to work productively at wrangling the thing I'm working with into better order.

I know what you're saying about the diagnoses stuff. If I'm honest, this is a recent thing of mine - I'm trying to lean into the medical and psychological approach a bit more lately, as it seems so much more cut and dry than the chaos, and might give me some easy answers. I'm still very cynical about it all deep down, and am really trying to convince myself. I've been seeing psychiatric help for about a decade now, taken [and currently taking] tablets and only recently have I felt the need to acknowledge I might be sick. Simply because I don't know what else to do.

First off, try to relax. I've had many occasions where too much hits my brain. It makes me dizzy, like I'm emotionally puking. You're not alone. Naturally, when a mind encounters too much, it's attention moves away from it towards more familiar content. But apparently our familiar content can breach into the infinite unknown. Youre not alone in this and there is an eventual solution, where your mind recognizes the wild unknown and turns away from it slightly, like shielding your eyes from the sun with your hand. This will take a few months or so.

I don't know where to begin on the rest. Your world has shattered and you are coming into your new world view. It's a long process with a lot of work. And I know the way my world shattered had unique characteristics for me, based on my world. Message me with more specific questions if you want.

I could still see but in the direction of the bridge it was like it was beneath some high-pitched scribbly madness. I changed my intention because it felt like a horror story.

I've been very overwhelmed the past few days by the nature of everything. I've been through all of the usual existential stuff in the past, read all the recommended writings and writers that people give etc. and i've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Before all of this, my existentialism was confined to just thinking about me and my place as both a human and an animal on this planet and in this society.

Recently, it's shifted to a far weirder, more abstract view. It's actually really hard to explain but I'll try: nothing seems real. I've read a lot about mental health so I'm familiar with derealisation and depersonalisation and I definitely (until now) experienced this in abundance. But now I sort of question absolutely everything. I honestly cannot see a way out of this tbh. I've flirted with suicide my whole life, but that at least had a basis in ""I am a human animal, I exist, and I will die and no longer exist"" but now I have no idea about anything.I know I'm being very vague, but it's more a gut feeling. I honestly cannot sleep because of this anymore. I just don't understand what anything is and how it all came to be. When I feel ""real"" I feel greatly distressed by all of this but am ultimately able to handle it. But the times I don't feel real it's.... bizarre and more than a bit harrowing.

If anyone here is familiar with psychedelics, this is what ego death was like for me the one time I thought I experienced it. Except I'm not high (I have quit drugs) and it's roughly 60% of the time. I don't know if this is a mental health issue or a philosophic issue. Even if I get ""better"" and start to feel like a human animal again, I won't forget these thoughts and this vague, but crushing, feeling. I am seriously at a loss here. Any help or guidance or recommended reading would be greatly appreciated. I know I'll never have any of these answers of course, but I just need something. The mental health side is way easier to understand for me, not any of this other shit. I am deadly serious because I don't think I'll ever feel right again. Many thanks.

edit: just thought I'd mention, this all came about after thinking about how humans have destroyed this planet, and remembering how I've heard that the conditions for life and this galaxy was such a remote possibly and humans have thrown it all away. Then I got hung up on the chances of all of this happening and now I cannot escape. I saw people talking about a TV show at work and it was at that point it all came crashing down around me.  I've thought about all these classic ""big questions"" in the past but now I cannot handle them.  What happened? I honestly think I might go pray."	-9

I think the only tension that even can really exist between idealism and materialism is between doltishly simplistic and/or demagogic  conceptions of each.  

On the other hand, if one presumes robust and nuanced conceptions of materialism and idealism, then conveniently enough, they actually fit together and establish a coherent and internally consistent whole.

Unfortunately, this article's conceptions of ""materialism"" and ""idealism"" are ridiculously simplistic and binaristic even by the already low standards of this silly ""debate.""

>Of course, both materialism and idealism may assert false notions about the world. 

The dreadfully shallow forms of ""materialism"" and ""idealism"" that the author addresses here not only may, but routinely do, assert false notions about the world.  That's not some sort of odd happenstance - it's a direct consequence of the fact that they're bludgeoningly simplistic conceptions of reality.  It no more surprising that they would assert false notions about the world than that a political system that was divided entirely and absolutely between fascists and anarchists would assert false notions about practical political solutions.

>Genuine philosophical materialism must be comfortable with saying “I don’t know” instead of seeking the false sense of security provided by unquestionable dogmas and superstitions.

This is certainly true, but it's noteworthy that the sort of ""materialism"" the author has addressed throughout the essay violates that directive right from the start.  He isn't addressing a nuanced conception of the likelihood of a primarily physical reality, but the ridiculously shallow and dogmatic certainty that it cannot possibly be anything but, which is rather obviously not something that people actually know.

>Without critical inquiry, the search for genuine knowledge is distorted and aborted by the fictitious explanations of mysticism, ideological propaganda, and religious catechism.

Much more to the point, without critical inquiry, there is no real ""search"" for genuine knowledge at all - all there is is the epistemological equivalent of ""mysticism, ideological propaganda, and religious catechism.""  And that's a fault that equally besets the conceptions of ""idealism"" and ""materialism"" the author addresses here, simply because they've both been reduced to doltishly simplistic and absolutist bits of mostly unexamined dogma."	-10

The power to influence or direct people’s behavior or the course of events

If every action is a result of a predetermined chain of events, then you can’t influence the chain of events, as it was predetermined or utterly random. So you can’t actually change anything, and you’re stuck in a meat suit just along for the ride. Thus, none of your actions are actually morally good or bad as you have no actual choice in the matter, so modern conceptions of “justice” are stupid because we care so much about revenge when the perpetrator was a victim of circumstance.

I didn't say anything about ""free will"". I generally try to avoid using that phrase in online discussions because its different definitions and implications muck up the conversation. My response was only addressing your idea that if we can't control who we are then we can't control anything at all.

>Here is a philosophical argument: You either do something because you want to, or because you’re forced to. Being forced isn’t freewill of course so we can discount those occasions, but regardless, everything you do consciously is because you want to.

philosophy	mainguy	"Your point about blocking negative emotions leading to emotional flat lining is definitely one I agree with, but also what you say about the positives of stoicism. Having the ability to sit down, day after day and chip away at something is invaluable in the long run, and Aurelius definitely steers us towards this end with his beautiful passages on the fleeting qualities of life versus the transcendent.

I suppose my remark was more toward stoicism being incomplete, again Sugrue's lecture beautifully elucidates this - the stoics are in many ways the proponents of Plato's silver virtues. 

The idea being that what they offer is a kind of melancholy, beautiful philosophy, but one which doesn't address a major side of life; Eros. The Dionysian side of the greeks is lost in stoicism, but it bleeds back into western life further along the line, in the troubadours and romantic poets of the renaissance, and most obviously in music today.

It's not that stoicism implies the absence of 'letting go' or 'emotional intensity', it just fails to make a case for these sides of life. Often letting go of discipline, ones own self, is even harder than holding it all together. I'd argue I see fewer people who are capable of truly dancing than those who can sit at a desk, doing monotnous work for the good of their future. Discipline, at least amongst my peers, is common, but eros is rare. 

The only reason I mention this absence in stoic philosophy is it is quite often handed round as a way of life, in the same way zen is, but I think it's important we modify and improve ancient ideas, bolting on what's necessary to create a fuller, richer way of thinking about the world."	14

My self transcendence is like this: I conceive of the Divine as a supreme and universal good, and want to be more like him than I am, which very much leads to a kind of ego death.

Here is a philosophical argument: You either do something because you want to, or because you’re forced to. Being forced isn’t freewill of course so we can discount those occasions, but regardless, everything you do consciously is because you want to. You never chose your wants, however you can condition yourself to want something, but then you’re moving the goal post because for you to do so you’d have to want it. There are a couple things you might say as a counterargument:

Q: I don’t like exercise but still do it. Isn’t this free will?

A: But you want to be healthy more than you want to exercise. Thus you exercise.

philosophy	hclasalle	"Different traditions have differing versions of the root of all evil. I think Buddhism calls greed, lust and anger the three portals of hell, and Krishna says something comparable in the Bhagavad Gita. 

In Epicurean philosophy, Diogenes’ Wall inscription mentions fears, and unlimited desires. The study of nature helps us to understand our natural limits and overcome these problems. 

https://theautarkist.wordpress.com/2017/03/25/diogenes-wall-on-the-pleasures/

“Well, what are the disturbing emotions? [They are] fears —of the gods, of death, and of [pains]— and, besides [these], desires that [outrun] the limits fixed by nature. These are the roots of all evils, and, [unless] we cut them off, [a multitude] of evils will grow [upon] us.” - Diogenes’ Wall"	-5
philosophy	codevil	"That is hardly the case *often* though. So few people dive deep enough into philosophy to even be barely passable as teachers of it. Many people who disagree with me are young and haven't read many books. And I do listen to people who are capable of disputing arguments on logical grounds, without cloaking personal attacks in indirection, writing them as assumptions of age, intelligence, motivations, or mood instead--which you shouldn't make anyway because they're irrelevant.

Anyway, I reacted to something that you said, true, but I was reacting to it as being something that he **would preach**. Please understand the difference. What you said fits rightly into his thoughts on the irrelevance of being hung up on suffering because in the grand scheme of things, none of anything that happens matters; to never complaining about one's position in society because such is the design of the logos. These aren't things that one should just take lightly and without critical thought, really, especially if it comes from a person in political power.

In any case, you aren't the first to tell me that ""X isn't what Marcus means"" and then explain their understanding of it that is different from another Stoic who disagrees with mine. Modern-day Stoics themselves do not have a consensus on everything that Marcus Aurelius Antoninus stood for, and that is exactly the point. Unlike more modern philosophers, there is too much variation even among Stoics themselves that interpretations of Meditations are only ever correct upon their own subjective understanding. And then, as I've said, there's much that can be said about belief and attachment as guides to the moral good."	-1
philosophy	Villvates	"Could it be that the translation is of poor quality? From what i've come to understand is that most of the time what Marcus is refering to is 'the Logos', the thing which permeates all, the stuff that gives things their quality. In some translations this is also refered to as 'the divine'. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos - the Wikipedia page insinuates that this means 'god', contrast this with Gregory Hays introduction in His translation of 'Meditations', and that distinktion is not so clear anymore (i am more inclined to call it 'fate' or something along those lines)

""Of the doctrines central to the Stoic worldview, perhaps the most important is the unwavering conviction that the world is organized in a rational and coherent way. More specifically, it is controlled and directed by an all-pervading force that
the Stoics designated by the term logos. The term (from which English “logic” and the suffix “-logy” derive) has a semantic range so broad as to be almost untranslatable. At a basic level it designates rational, connected thought—
whether envisioned as a characteristic (rationality, the ability to reason) or as the product of that characteristic (an intelligible utterance or a connected discourse). Logos operates both in individuals and in the universe as a whole.
In individuals it is the faculty of reason. On a cosmic level it is the rational principle that governs the organization of the universe. 1 In this sense it is synonymous with “nature,” “Providence,” or “God.” (When the author of John’s Gospel tells us that “the Word”—logos—was with God and is to be identified with God, he is borrowing Stoic terminology.)
All events are determined by the logos, and follow in an unbreakable chain of cause and effect. Stoicism is thus from the outset a deterministic system that appears to leave no room for human free will or moral responsibility. In reality the Stoics were reluctant to accept such an arrangement, and
attempted to get around the difficulty by defining free will as a voluntary accommodation to what is in any case inevitable. According to this theory, man is like a dog tied to a moving wagon. If the dog refuses to run along with the wagon he will be dragged by it, yet the choice remains his: to run or be dragged. In the same way, humans are responsible for their choices and actions, even though these have been anticipated by the logos and form part of its plan. Even actions which appear to be—and indeed are—immoral or unjust advance the overall design, which taken as a whole is harmonious and
good. They, too, are governed by the logos.
But the logos is not simply an impersonal power that
governs and directs the world. It is also an actual substance that pervades that world, not in a metaphorical sense but in a form as concrete as oxygen or carbon. In its physical
embodiment, the logos exists as pneuma, a substance imagined by the earliest Stoics as pure fire, and by Chrysippus as a mixture of fire and air. Pneuma is the power —the vital breath—that animates animals and humans. It is, in Dylan Thomas’s phrase, “the force that through the green
fuse drives the flower,” and is present even in lifeless
materials like stone or metal as the energy that holds the object together—the internal tension that makes a stone a stone. All objects are thus a compound of lifeless substance and vital force. When Marcus refers, as he does on a number
of occasions, to “cause and material” he means the two elements of these compounds—inert substance and animating pneuma—which are united so long as the object itself exists. When the object perishes, the pneuma that animated it is reabsorbed into the logos as a whole. This process of destruction and reintegration happens to individual objects at
every moment.""

philosophy	arikdondi	That is a familiar argument against free will. But what if it doesn’t work? Here’s a non-sequitur: “when something happens, it’s always as a result of something else. Therefore everything that specifically happened, happened necessarily as a consequence of the causes that were present.” It assumes another premise along the lines of “for every cause or set of causes, there is only one possible result or set of results.” But what if that’s not true? What if human beings (or other creatures with advanced consciousness) occasionally encounter situations that are causally overdetermined, ie. there are more than one cause, or more than one set of causes, that could result in a result, but not necessarily all are activated by the action of the human being (or other creature)?	2

Perhaps its one of those things that once you have it, you can then let it slip a little when you want to have fun..... But being awash in a sea of disregulated emotionalnresponses is no fun at all. 

And while I think there is a Brene Brown thing going on where if we do not allow ourselves to feel negative emotions, all of our emotional affects are flattened; I don’t think that’s what Stoicism, as its core, is advocating for. 

Its not about*not feeling* emotions, its about *not being controlled by your emotions*. I’m an Artist. Passion sucks. It gets you so far and no further; whereas sitting at your desk at the same time every day does wonders for your Art.

philosophy	BobCrosswise	"First and broadly, I see very little discussion of the matter nominally under consideration, and the only argument that's put forth is one in favor of establishing some sort of committee empowered to oversee matters of AI ethics (which honestly smacks of a sinecure to me).

That said, to the matter that should have been at hand - all of the concerns that we have regarding proper ethical treatment of less-than-fully-conscious creatures are based on literal physical suffering - the sort of suffering that's a result of simply possessing pain receptors and a nervous system.  The exact reason that those concerns are even coherent in the first place is that biological animals possess all of the necessary equipment to be able to ""feel"" ""pain"" with or without full consciousness.  

None of that applies to AI though.  They aren't biological creatures fitted with a network of pain receptors, a nervous system and an analogue of the parietal lobe.  There is no arguably ""lesser"" version of AI that might not be fully conscious but can still feel pain, so all of the reasoning that supports consideration of the proper ethical treatment of less-than-fully-conscious creatures simply doesn't apply.

The ethical issues with AI arise specifically with the potential for consciousness, which in turn can provide a basis for existential suffering.  That's really the only sort of ""suffering"" of which an AI might even be capable (unless one were to go to all of the necessary trouble of fitting an AI with all of the necessary analogues of a nervous system that could communicate a ""gut-level"" sensation of pain, which would appear to be even more complicated than it would be pointless).  Short of the point at which an AI might be self-aware enough to suffer existentially, there exists no mechanism by which it might suffer *at all* - no nerve endings, no pain receptors and no analogue of the parietal lobe.

Now, a case might be made for some committee empowered to oversee efforts to isolate instances in which an AI might be capable of existential suffering, but even that seems to smack of a sinecure, since that does indeed appear to be, as the authors briefly mention, a ""problem"" that will solve itself.

>If the AI is like Data or Dolores, it can complain and defend itself, initiating a discussion of its rights.

Exactly.  Existential suffering (which, again, is the ONLY suffering of which an AI might be capable unless and until someone were to go to the extraordinary lengths of outfitting one with all of the necessary analogues of the systems by which biological creatures feel pain) requires language to provide the necessary symbols to serve as objects of thought, so we should be able to easily recognize if/when an AI might suffer existentially because they'll be able to say so.  If they lack the ability to say so (save cases in which that lack is a malfunction rather than an absence), then it would seem to be the case that they do not possess the symbols necessary to even conceptualize, much less experience, existential suffering.  And unless and until someone outfits an AI with all of the necessary analogues to the systems by which biological creatures feel pain, existential suffering is the only threat an AI might face."	-22

It's fascinating, really, that even in my classes, I (atheist) find myself agreeing with theologians who contemplate on the nature of ""belief"", of how it is the underlying driving force of all of our actions, and which is really a form of attachment; ergo, notions of detachment are just incompatible with it.

I read the Hays translation (known for not being heavily editorialized unlike the others) slowly and very attentively. Still found it direly lacking of profundity. There are many other moral, political, and religious philosophers out there with far more intricate positive and normative views of the universe--which is understandable, because Aurelius is *ancient*.

philosophy	ManticJuice	"Punishments are carried out in response to a perceived transgression, that's simply what punishment means -

My point is that we must acknowledge that punishments can be just or unjust, as this is what allows us to evaluate our punishments to tell if they are or are not just. If we assume all punishments are just, then we can simply claim that, because we punish, we are acting justly. We must make sure that we are not acting simply out of spite but instead from a sense of justice, and we can only do that when we acknowledge we might in fact be acting wrongly, and maintain a sense of critical inquiry towards our social practices, particularly in such life-defining cases as punishment for crimes."	-5

philosophy	ManticJuice	">It may be a punishment but it might not be a just punishment. I think this is what Buttock means.

Then we have to be clear about our terms. If we decide that only just punishments can be called punishments, we can simply claim that what we do is punish, thus, *quod erat demonstrandum*, our punishments are just and thus not subject to criticism. All punishment comes as response to a perceived wrong, and I don't think the article equivocates here - punishment has a long history in humanity and hasn't always been strictly tied to notions of justice, but rather served a broad social regulatory function. To imagine punishments as ""true"" punishments only when just is to falsely apply our present legal and judicial framework anachronistically to historical practices of punishment. We must therefore acknowledge that punishments are not necessarily just and all punishments therefore subject to moral scrutiny. We must ask why we punish and to what degree it is effective.

>We may disagree about the exact criteria for rightful punishment but at least we must agree that there's a difference.  
>  
>Denying this difference would boil down to denying morality and rendering the person a moral relativist or a moral nihilist.

You seem to be agreeing with me here. My criticism was that in labelling only just punishments as ""punishment"", we efface the difference between just and unjust punishment and therefore have no criteria of justness to evaluate punishments against. This relegates us to a world of punishments which are always just, not because they have been evaluated thusly, but simply because punishments are intrinsically just. Meanwhile, the practices of others are not really punishments, but transgressions, unjust actions. This is either moral relativism or nihilism, in that what a culture considers its punishments are inherently just and there is no objective criteria of justness, or else there is no objective justness by default, and justness is simply what is imposed when we punish, and what is violated when cultures other than ours enact what they think to be punishment. Being clear about the fact that punishments can be both just and unjust is what allows us to preserve an objetive criterion of justness and evaluate our punishments accordingly. Failure to do so renders punishment beyond critique, and justness reduced to a mere function of the social practice *de jour*."	-14

philosophy	ManticJuice	"> I also want to clarify that I don't think consciousness is a binary thing that snaps on when we philosophically introspect

This is inconsistent with your claim that we are automatons most of the time. Automatons possess no conscious awareness whatsoever, thus implying a binary of conscious/non-conscious. I agree that conscious awareness is a matter of degree but I simply do not agree with the notion that when we are not paying close attention, the world as experienced simply blinks out of existence."	3
philosophy	ManticJuice	">Except it isn't. The question is whether the room understands, not whether Searle understands. Searle thinks he has to be the one understanding, but he's mistaken.

Only on the systems account; the actual thought experiment is about Searle, taking the ""room"" as understanding is a specific modification to the original experiment. The room doesn't understand either though, in my opinion, I don't see how a room can ""understand"" anything - it doesn't have a mind.

>No, it isn't. His specific point was that the room can't understand because Searle doesn't need to be able to understand in order to run the room. Again, nobody making the system argument cares whether Searle understands. Searle misses the entire point of the system argument by presenting different systems, and showing that in each case, one small part of the system doesn't understand.

Well you're conflating two arguments then. Searle's original argument is not a systems argument, and frankly I don't find the systems argument convincing.

>It's like saying ""well, each neuron can't do arithmetic, so the brain doesn't doesn't do arithmetic. What? Oh, ok, well, each transistor doesn't do arithmetic, so the computer can't do arithmetic.""

Sure, but neurons collectively make up a mind which is capable of understanding, a room doesn't.

>My response is that these are all understanding in the same way. And that's because the computation is sophisticated enough to understand itself recursively.

This presupposes that computation = consciousness, thus begging the question; it isn't proof that computation understands. Searle doesn't understand because he doesn't possess the requisite grounded concepts involved in the symbol manipulation, whereas both the original lady and the clone do because they possess minds which have the experience and memories required. The machine does not possess intentionality whatsoever, thus does not understand.

>It's not ""the syntax"" that's understanding. It's the process of manipulating those records that does the understanding.

Only when that process is part of a mind, in my opinion. Mere mechanistic syntax manipulation can be done by a complex system of pipes and water, this doesn't produce understanding.

>Because being aware that you're seeing yellow, thinking you're seeing yellow, and seeing yellow are all the same thing.  
>  
>How do you know you're seeing yellow? What makes you think you're seeing yellow? Because you're seeing yellow. That's exactly the tautology you're disliking me pointing out.

I don't dislike you pointing that out, I agree completely. My point is that ""you're seeing yellow because you appear to be seeing yellow"" isn't an explanation as to how/why subjective experience is generated through objective processes.

>Because what you are aware of is caused by the computation taking place.

What causes that awareness? This is the crux of the issue - you keep telling me how particular qualitative experiences come about, such as seeing yellow (instead of something else) but what I'm actually asking is why experience *itself* arises from objective, physical processes. I'm not asking ""why do I see yellow"" but ""why do I see at all"", for which you have not provided an answer.

>But seriously, no, it's not tautological. It's recursive.

It's a circular definition. ""Computations which are conscious are computations involved in consciousness"". You have no marker to verify whether a computation is conscious other than the being in question being conscious, which, because you have no additional marker, you cannot verify.

>The computations experienced by the subject are the ones that are computing what the subject experiences.

And again, this is circular. You have no way of defining which computations are conscious other than their being involved in computing consciousness. This is not a definition.

>The same way anyone does.

Which is not at all - we can only infer consciousness, we cannnot directly verify its presence in another entity.

>But that's true of every theory of why consciousness exists. It's neither more or less provable to you that I am conscious regardless of which of our preferred theories we believe.

Untrue - if panpsychism is correct, then all matter is liable to being conscious depending upon its arrangement. It's starting from the assumption that basic consciousness is pervasive, whereas other theories start from an assumed exceptionality regarding the existence of consciousness in the first place.

>It can ""explain"" subjective consciousness sort of like this: Newton says ""All things fall at the same speed regardless of mass."" Why? Because they're made out of matter that all falls at the same speed. (That's panpsychism, if you didn't catch it. ;-)

I didn't catch an explanation of consciousness or any panpsychism there I'm afraid, you'll have to clarify.

>How does this differ from panpsychism?

Because you can't objectively measure subjectivity.

>Here, let's get specific: how would you go about confirming the presence or absense of subjectivity in me?

Inference from our similarity. However, the point is that panpsychism holds consciousness to be fundamental, so things are more likely to be conscious than my starting from a solipsitic, physicalist position of the exceptionality of human consciousness/the exceptionality of my own consciousness. The fact is that we cannot directly verify whether another entity is having subjective experience, but panpsychism suggests that subjectivity is pervasive, thus increasing the likelihood of the presence of other minds. Computationalism must justify which compuations are conscious and why, and test for them in other entities from there, which is a tricky empirical task which panpsychism allows for (in testing for particular kinds of qualitative experience, cognition etc) but does not require such experimentation to prove that consciousness itself exists in some form or another.

>If the calculation is structured in such a way that it is calculating what inputs it should respond to and modeling its own calculations, then you have a subject embedded inside the calculation.

Self-reference doesn't constitute subjectivity. A hall of mirrors is not a mind. You have to justfiy your move from self-referential calculation to subjectivity, as you've just made a huge leap there.

>Plenty of things calculate, but presumably they're not all Microsoft Word. That doesn't mean Microsoft Word isn't made out of calculations.

I'm not sure why this is relevant. I asked why some computations are conscious, and noted that presumably not all are - are you claiming all computations are conscious now?

>Awareness of particular qualia would be particular portions of the calculation of the subject's experience.

The presence of qualia would be calculation, the fact of awareness remains unexplained.

>If you believe the behavior of your brain causes your thoughts, and you believe that if you think you're aware of yellow then you are indeed aware of yellow, then that's the explanation for how the behavior of your brain can cause subjective experience.

That's not an explanation of subjectivity, as although there is a strong correlation between mental and physical, we do not know the causal mechanism involved and thus cannot say ""the behaviour of the brain causes thoughts"" and use this as a causal explanation. You are required to explain what it is about neural events which cause subjective experience. If you say it is the computations, then again I would ask what it is about computation that generates subjectivity, and what it is about conscious computations that separates them from non-conscious computations, and how this mechanism creates a perceiving subject.

>Panpsychism has other explanatory gaps...I don't, however, see how one could even start to figure out or investigate why one pile of matter has a conscious experience and another almost identical pile doesn't, if you don't believe that the behavior of the interactions between those pieces of matter are the cause of the subjective experience.

At this point I'm not sure if you're deliberately misrepresenting panpsychism or just haven't understood it. There are no identical piles of matter where one is conscious and the other is not. All matter contains consciousness, and different arrangements of matter will give rise to different sorts of consciousness. For example, arranging matter into the form of a human organism would appear to give rise to the kind of consciousness we possess. We know this becuase we are such a material human organism and possess the kind of consciousness which we are currently experiencing. The ""cause of the subjective experience"" is the intrinsic nature of matter, so identical matter and its interactions will involve identical subjective experiences.

>And yes, neither of us can prove the other is conscious. Neither of us knows the answer to all the gaps in knowledge, or we wouldn't even be having this conversation.

Then I'm not sure how you could say earlier that you would test for the presence of a subject to check whether the relevant computations are consciously experienced ""the same way anyone does"". Unless you mean ""not at all"", at which point you have no way to verify which computations are conscious and which are not, because you have circularly defined conscious computations as ""those involved in computing conscious experience""; without a way to test for conscious experience, you have no way to test for conscious computations.

>If you understand what I'm trying to convey, but you're not convinced I'm right, please distinguish that for me from you don't understand what I'm saying. Because I'm not really trying to convince you I'm right.

I understand perfectly what you're saying, I am just trying to point out that CTM is more problematic than you seem to think and panpsychism stronger than you give it credit for.

( I hope no one is offended by my beliefs)

From a Heavenly point of view, God being who he is. Creator, all-knowing, all powerful. If we were to take his point of view then he knows everything from beginning to end and from end to beginning. There are no surprises. So up there I believe we are predestined. Everything that we're going to do, every decision we're going to make, every circumstance we're going to be in, He knows. Therefore predestination is it correct concept.

So now here on Earth, we are not infinite, all-knowing creatures. So we cannot always figure out what's coming next. Any decision we must make we have the experience of contemplation, of measuring out pros and cons, deciding benefits vs cost. So for us, we have free will. We have the ability to choose or not to choose anyting! Am I going to have a hamburger today or am I going to have a pizza today? Am I going to put on sandals today or am I going to wear tennis shoes today? Do I want to save for a car or do I want to save for a vacation? Before these questions come to us we do not have the answer. We must decide the answer. That is why I say again this would be considered free will. We have the Power of Choice over everything in our lives.

Now determinism, in my opinion, would go hand-in-hand with free will. If we make up our mind to do something, or to be something, then a lot of us have the willpower - the time, the effort, and the energy to make happened whatever it is we want. But those three parts must be within us in order to accomplish whatever it is we have planned. If they are not there, then we might be blown around with the Wind.

philosophy	nonsequitrist	"I think you're misunderstanding the Stoic practice in question, though in your defense the article (and the ancient philosophers) uses words that match your misapprehension before it clarifies its exposition, and the clarification may not have registered with you. 

The Stoic practice is not to think about *death* when you hug your child, and certainly not to be ""painfully aware"" of it, any more than you think about winter when you enjoy a just-picked, ripe peach. But knowing that the delicious peach experience is precious because it's only available for a short time can intensify the pleasure of it. You're thinking about the peach, not the absence of the peach, but *awareness* of the peach's unavailability at other times is also present, without occupying your conscious mind overmuch, because your conscious mind is full of the sweet peach, sweeter because of this practice.

If you think that this kind of layered consciousness is weird, well, everyone does it pretty much every two seconds out of three for their entire waking, and some of their sleeping, lives, except for practiced meditators and practitioners of similar stuff. Stoicism is about taking charge of this layered consciousness to a greater than normal degree and dispelling the chaotic and painful lack of control that it exerts on nearly everyone.

By thinking about death with such focus on the possible pain, you are not being Stoic. You are actually magnifying your distress, and your distress is a false god, to use a Stoic trope. Stoicism is coming to terms with death, not by feeling its pain before its time, but by recognizing its inevitability and cherishing life all the more while life exists.

When someone has a near-death experience, it's a trope to hear them urge others to live every day as if it's their last. This is not an exhortation to think about death, but to live because death cannot be avoided or safeguarded against. If you understand this, perhaps you can see that the Stoic position is to seize this mindset and apply it more extensively, without needing to risk death first."	1

The Stoics believe that the only thing of value is your own virtue-your character. Therefore all external things, including family members, are not of intrinsic value but are only preferred indifferents. Because the Stoics also see emotions (correctly, in my opinion), as cognitive judgements of value, and grief involves judging that something of great value to you (i.e. a mother, a child, a father) has been lost, they would reject grief as irrational and false. 

Thus, even if you (quite wisely) accept the Stoic advice to remind yourself that your loved ones are mortal, if you followed through on their theory than all kinds of grief should be expunged, not just transformed. I agree that people grieve in different ways, and we shouldn't assume that someone is acting suspiciously, inauthentically or ""incorrectly"" because they are not grieving like we would.

When we move to a 4-d perspective, we come to think instead that me sitting here is merely *part* of an object (a temporal part), and that in a sense I am the combination of all my temporal parts--a space-time worm, as people say. But we could make the same move again: we could say that the worm is itself merely a part of something extended in yet another dimension. If we think it's temporal, we could call it hypertime. An object would then be the combination of these hypertemporal parts.

Finally, if one thought there was only one hypertime, or even just that something akin to presentism were true for hypertime, that might get something like what you're talking about. It actually sounds like kind of a cool view.

That said, although this seems logically a somewhat reasonable argument to try out, I don't know if it latches onto reality in any understanding ways."	12

I think I can. what I'm trying to say is some portion of our value system always changes. This is reflected by how different generation deal with different social & moral issues. The general belief dictates to a large degree what's right & wrong but that's also to say that the general belief also knows issues aren't clear cut & evident yet!

philosophy	Rathwood	">Central to their worldview was the need to distinguish between what we can and cannot control, and waste no time worrying about the latter.

I suppose that this idea is where I personally find conflict with Stoicism.

I agree that it's probably better not to ""waste time worrying"" about things that you cannot control, but exactly how are you supposed to make that determination?

And what if, in making it, you calculate incorrectly?

It seems to me that there is a rather large and treacherous margin for error when it comes to determining what one can and cannot influence or control. After all, we are all constrained by our perspectives and limited insights and information.

Writing something off as ""outside of your sphere of influence"" may reduce your personal stress, but it may also put you at a practical disadvantage, compared to where you might have been had you only made even a cursory effort at influencing it.

You never know what effect you have. You can't ever see all the moving parts.

And sometimes, making a gamble pays off.

Therefore, it seems to me, pursue what compels you and live as honestly to yourself as you can. This may be the o ly way to get what you want."	-9

philosophy	autumnhymn	"I learned about myself via this article and it's brought a bit more peace of mind. I hadn't realized that I'd been using this as a coping mechanism for a lot of my life but I had never really thought to read up on Stoics or the philosophy behind it for pure lack of interest. Having no material to ""judge"" Stoics I had been harshly judging myself recently (past three-ish years) for what I perceived as... I guess a deficiency in how I mourned in general; seemingly little or not at all. If it feels that awful without knowledge of the subject from an inside view, I can hardly guess how vilified the practice is from the outside. 

That said I do wonder why in the age we're in right now why more people haven't visibly taken up Stoicism to cope with... well, the age we're in right now. I'm curious, though, if the act of treasuring all things in this way always leads to a ""truer"" mourning period in people as it did with myself (I certainly didn't do it specifically to cut my own mourning time, only to enjoy things while I had them the best I could) or if the mileage varies person to person?

I don't feel comfortable actively recommending giving the practice a try or chance as mourning seems to me a very personal act in the first place but the effects that Stoicism might have on a society that has, at large, taken to and accepted it's... tennants? Values or practices? It's interesting to me what those effects/changes might look like."	-1

philosophy	tedrick79	I do not believe that we were designed to be able to cope with death.  Death is a curse upon us. The mortal inflicted onto an immortal soul. This would be the reasoning as to why we have such a terrible time dealing with the loss of others. We simply never were designed to do it. We have to make it up as we go. How we cope with it. What we do. Our most fundamental religious beliefs deal very much with death and what it's meaning is.  Stoicism is an age old philosophy. I cannot say it is right or wrong it is a method of dealing with emotions but not allowing them to govern you. If that sounds strangely Vulcan then you get it. It is a method for dealing. For some it can be a Godsend and others it would be impossible.	-10
philosophy	Thanksforlistenin	It’s interesting your view on child death, it’s only a recently new idea that child death is worse than adult death (someone in their 40’s) because of how far we’ve come in health science and medicine we put more value on young life. Only until less than a century ago did humans start grieving a child’s death as much as they do. Children were frail back in the day and so couples had many to account for the inevitable loss of life. It was so common place that they weren’t even grieved in the same way today. Back then a man who had a hard earned life to lose with a wife and children and a good job in his prime was more reason to grieve for then a child who held no property or job or any lasting influence or relationships. They also couldn’t afford to stop and grieve every child they had die on them. They had to keep on working to keep themselves alive and many times didn’t have the luxury to stop and put a lot of thought into the death and have the time to mourn deeply.	-19

The oligarchy has no clear successor and there would be too much of a power vacuum to allow him to step down without everything collapsing on his head, so he has to keep playing the game and pursuing new conquests as his underlings squabble and cause problems; Chechnya is killing gay people and he has to tacitly approve of this kind of destabilizing nonsense because his position is too contentious to micromanage.	-24
philosophy	avaflies	"Man, I think you really misread my comment.

I'm going to add on to what you and /u/blakkstar6 had to say. Up until pretty recently it wasn't guaranteed your kids would survive to adolescence. Not even half would make it in many cases. What's not being considered is that parents didn't develop an attachment to their children in the same way that we do now. In order to survive you had to accept that your children would die. It wasn't beneficial to be emotionally invested in babies because they could die at any moment.

This isn't the case anymore. For most parents the day of their child's birth was the most impactful, emotional, spectacular day of their lives. This modern experience of child birth is incomprehensible to people that have not had children, incomprehensible in the sense that they can't ever understand or appreciate that experience until they go through it themselves. That's what I was trying to say with my comment. Yeah, people die. Kids die. Babies die. Everyone dies. This is a fact of life. But the *experience* of losing a child is nearly impossible to fully understand if you haven't gone through it yourself. Nothing is comparable.

The unfair death of an adult child is horrific but there are things you can point at to find closure. If that person achieved any major milestone or dream of theirs you can at least find comfort in that. It's not the same with children. You look at other children, you see them grow and blossom and achieve all of those milestones that yours never got the chance to reach. There will never be any solace in their death because they had no life to begin with.

It's unthinkable nowadays. That's not a bad thing. We become invested in our children. We put everything we are in to them. And we produce better, smarter, more capable humans because of it. Is that really a bad thing?

Also I want to say... the points don't matter. I see people downvoted all the time who are making totally valid and constructive comments. Drawing attention to it just generally annoys people and if you say ""bring on the downvotes"" you **are** going to get downvoted. You're literally asking for it.

I believe there is a time to share a motion and there's a Time 2 use a more logical approach to life. My personal thought on death, is that it is not an end, it is a doorway to another beginning. 

I've had this believe since childhood. I don't know how this room feels about God, or Jesus, or any heavenly aspects based on scripture, so I definitely am not going to go into detail on those aspects of my belief.

Let's just for the sake of inclusion, say that there's something out there, and when I learned about that something out there, it occurred to me that when one passes from this existence they move on to another existence so I have never ever cried when someone has passed. Whether they have been close to me or whether they we're not ever a part of my life to begin with, death just his not ever been an end.

I'm serious folks! When I was five or six years old I had a first grade friend died and I knew she went to somewhere else and she was alive. Everybody else in the classroom was crying. I couldn't do it. I didn't even know about different religious beliefs.

Strangely enough, my reaction to my father and other relatives deaths have been the complete opposite. I was eight years, when father was gone. 

He was the first, so it affected me indeed. First I was scared and couldn't understand why. He was at the hospital with a lingering pain. Then my older brother comes bawling and saying he died. I was like, ""Oh. Well... That's a pity.""

And then just accepted that as life.

Years later, happened with one beloved aunt that was an angel. This time was even more extreme.

I wasn't even sad, I was indifferent.

More recently, when my kittens died I was much more affected. Now I realized it's just how I internalized it. How you think shapes greatly how you feel, so it was natural my extremely aloof teen years, and my normal adult current time were seasoned by very different experiences, shaped exactly by how I viewed things.

I developed the attachment emotions I didn't have in my childhood, but now I'm feeling like taking my natural-born stoic instance back. I think it's more convenient. I still love people; I just don't think sorrow is something to embrace, however."	6

Others just process things differently than your norm. There's not necessarily anything wrong or sick with that. 

Human mind is just too complex. It's ridiculous for anyone to tell how exactly should you emotionally react to x event.

But they were also times to see friends and family you didn't normally see, have some good food, take your mind off of things...

Now, my stepdad's funeral was also rather annoying because my mom spent about 25k on it because she didn't want my stepdad's family talking bad about her.

philosophy	Throwaway_2-1	" >Do you think it's really just about continuing to think about death. Is that what is meant by 'practice' in this situation?

Kind of, yes. I'm thinking that for me to tell you that you can just solve all your problems permanently with one simple trick would be a lie. Your anxieties will always be there. To think about them is reasonable. To let them control you isn't. But  a person can't just *stop* negative thought patterns on command. It takes work, and it will not ""go away"" permanently it will just become something that you will eventually become strong enough to face. It's why people say that they ""practice stoicism"". So, as well as setting high expectations for how strong you can become you also have to cut yourself slack if you falter. No one is perfect, and especially at combating anxiety. You shouldn't look to be cured. Just try to get better. And when you're a little better, try to take it a little bit further. Eventually it will be *almost like* you're cured.

&nbsp;

But let me just say this: while I do believe that that anyone can benefit from stoicism, I don't necessarily think that it's the best thing for everyone. You may find a different school of thought works better for you. I really do believe that some people may need something different than me if they come from a different perspective. If it works for you, go for it (as long as the ideas you study are focused on  strengthening or empowering yourself). Point is if you keep working on it and trying, maybe you may gain perspective and see your problems in a way you can manage. Just try not to be discouraged. The first part is is to realize that it's OK to struggle. Almost everyone does struggle in some way. IDK , I feel like I'm rambling here. Keep in mind that I'm just some guy online, what do I really know? I can only really tell you a fraction of what I've seen. Hopefully it's of some use. Stay stubborn and keep struggling.  You will eventually gain the perspective you need with the philosophy that suits you best."	11

philosophy	unknown_poo	Consciously it makes sense, but it's in the realm of the unconscious that everything is really happening. It's kind of like, why still have emotional attachment to someone that isn't interested in you at all? Rationally it makes no sense. But when you delve deeper and understand the nature of trauma, of abandonment, of need, of fear on a primordial level, of underlying beliefs and fundamental conceptualizations, then things start to make sense why we act the way we do when it on a high level doesn't make sense. Often our neurotic pursuit for status in society is a simply a complex coping mechanism meant to distract us from uncomfortable truths we haven't spent time and energy thinking about and processing. From one perspective, perhaps it could be said that we're all alive, yes, but living in different realities.	-3
philosophy	Postcolony_Of_Bats	"I think those are mostly salient points. How we would build a system that ensures ""the people"" *actually* have control over the means of production is a very tough question. You don't have to look very hard or very long to find plenty of historical examples of state-run employers exploiting their workers, and even if we move beyond questions of corruption and assume the state management is honest, altruistic, and adheres unfailingly to the democratically chosen course, there's absolutely still a possibility that the democratically chosen course will be unfair and unequal. One relatively mild example of this is products designed to cater to niche or minority population needs: kosher or halal or vegan protein options, beauty products that cater to people of color, left-handed scissors, and so on. Under a capitalist system, access to these products certainly isn't perfect, but as long as there is any measurable market for them someone will probably scramble to fill it. Under a more managed or democratically controlled economy, these minority populations would have to rely on the awareness and benevolence of the majority, which could easily be worse. I don't know that I necessarily accept that line of reasoning, but I don't think it's unreasonable or untenable, by any means. I think things like that are absolutely a valid concern about putting most/all production decisions in the hands of democracy. 

On the other hand, I don't think these are necessarily persuasive arguments for favoring a capitalistic system over more managed or democratic alternatives, primarily because all of these problems still exist in capitalist societies. A state-managed industry could definitely exploit employers, but it's not like private enterprises *don't* exploit them. Democratic processes failing to address the needs of low-population communities is already a huge problem the impacts far more vital aspects of those communities' lives than things like access to scissors and shades of makeup. In other words, the problems you're talking about aren't really new and unique to a more managed economy or meaningfully more serious under one, they're problems we already face and already have to solve under our current economic/political system. Moreover, some of the changes being made could actually help alleviate these problems; there may always be power in managers, but making management more legally and directly accountable to the needs and demands of those they manage can help to ensure that power is not abused. I think all the concerns you bring up are things we absolutely need to take seriously when considering any changes to legal, political, or economic systems. But I also don't think we should favor the status quo simply because its most egregious harms are things we've learned to ignore or at least come to take for granted.

In terms of workers exploiting their employer, I still don't realistically think that's possible under our current legal/economic system. Even in the situation you mention, Employer X might take a loss or make lower profits than they wanted, but ultimately they're not likely to be the one who winds up homeless. Employer X can't just wave a magic wand and convert the factory into food, but they're far more able to turn the factory in the food than the workers are to make food just appear out of thin air. Especially in modern economies, where the owners can just move production to places where labor is cheaper, having the factory simply close is a far graver threat to the workers than the owners. I mean, look at what actually happens and who primarily suffers when stores/factories/whatever close in the real world. It's not typically the people running the private equity firms that own the factories and stores missing rent/mortgage payments or relying on free lunch programs to ensure their kids are fed."	-14
philosophy	Brian	">Tragedy that does not elicit meaningful change is a waste

Is it?  And even if so, can't meaningful change sometimes be worse?  Take 911 - this resulted in lots of meaningful change: the war on Terror, the invasion of Afghanistan and then Iraq, and lots lots more.  Should we be glad we didn't ""waste"" this tragedy?  Or might it have been better if we *didn't* do so much?

>using all of our rigors to decide what is the best course of action to make a resolution

The aftermath of a tragedy doesn't seem like it's the best time for this.  And in particular, it doesn't seem like a time when the *response* to rigorously reasoned through solutions is going to be more likely to be carried out than the response to some idiological demagogue advancing their pet cause through charged emotion.

As such, maybe having norms that caution us to delay responses before we have time to act, and that discourage such exploitation may not be such a bad thing.  Looking at things **only** from the perspective of how it can advance your cause ignores the fact that you're not the only actor involved."	12

Everything and everyone is transient, death is an inevitability and thus simply not worth fearing. ive never understood those who are preoccupied by fear of death, it is guaranteed to happen so why waste time worrying about it?"	-6
philosophy	blakkstar6	"Okay... I think I know what you are trying to say. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you are implying that the death of a child is nothing new in human history. You are right about that. Depending on the time and the community, half or more of all the children ever born died in infancy and childhood. Even a couple hundred years ago, this was true in a large part of the world, so you are also right that it wasn't even rare a short time ago.

Here's where you slipped up. Your first comment also seems to imply that due to racial or ancestral memory, we should not take the death of a child so hard. It has happened alot, after all, at times more often than not. But that reality has not been the case since the advent of modern medicine. Parents losing a child has become a rarity (in the 'civilized' world with the technology to share the experience on a world-spanning network of information). Culture is more powerful than any as yet unproven ancestral memory, so the rarity of child death has made that rarity expected, as another commenter said above (also to steal your amendment for the other side of the argument), as a virtual impossibility. We find ourselves unprepared for the event because it simply doesn't happen like the history books say it once did. This is where the philosophy comes into play.

Just because your wife has a 97.68% chance of making it through childbirth doesn't mean you shouldn't prepare for the 2.32% chance she won't. Just because your child is almost guaranteed to survive until he moves out doesn't mean you shouldn't be ready for them to get hit by a bus, or knifed for their lunch money, or kidnapped and trafficked into unsavory industries. To fail to consider these possibilities, and prepare your reactions to them, is to be complacent, and is a lack of virtue.

But to accept those things and expect people to be numb to them because it's always been a part of life? That is less than entry-level understanding of stoicism. I don't have any context at all, and I doubt you do either, but losing a child, especially the first time, must have felt exactly as the comment above suggested, even for parents who lived in a world where it was more or less the norm. The fact that you had no choice but to replace Junior as quickly as possible couldn't possibly negate the profound loss and failure of it. At the end of the day, though we may strive for it... we are not perfectly rational beings. We may begrudge ourselves for our weakness in grieving for what was, but we must never accept *being* begrudged by anyone else. Nor must we accept being begrudged for being ready for the tidal wave of sorrow such an event would cast against us, mentally chained to the beach in full scuba gear. Come what may, I will prevail. There's absolutely nothing contemptible about that."	-16

I mostly agree with the article except for the last part where it said that we should make an effort to remember our loved ones fondly. The temptation to remember just the good memories and, by implication, block out the bad ones, skews too heavily towards wishful thinking. Every person is a mish-mash of good and bad memories. In death, we become no more than the totality of how other people remember us. So to remember one side of them, and forget about the other, morphs that memory into a version that only serves us by making us feel good.

So I see the question of why the universe exists as having a range of possible answers, some involving intentions, some not (e.g. many worlds theory). Determinism needn't even be applied, since even if libertarian free will exists, people's intentions will still be what motivates (causes) them to act, even more so in fact. Unless you're a Cartesian and you think mental events like thoughts, intentions, beliefs, etc. have no material properties, I don't see why you'd disagree with this.

So, given an individual arrives at university as a conservative thinker, the study of philosophy might on its own produce a liberal thinker (who may still arrive at relatively conservative conclusions), but the study of philosophy at the vast majority of schools in the US will produce a static anti-conservative thinker. 

I'm very much a liberal (in the philosophical sense), which today means that I’m most often derided by my peers as far too conservative. One area in which this is marked most sharply (and I think this is best termed under the general blanket of moral philosophy) is in discussions that rely on theories of intersectionalism, special epistemology, communitarian ontology, and the like, all of which actively decry individualism and traditional liberalism. As a liberal (in specific) and a philosopher (in general), it seems anti-philosophical to suggest:

(1) that there are matters of philosophy about which certain people can never explore or investigate; 

(2) that certain questions in and of themselves are immoral when asked by certain people;

Her nine week old daughter Azaria was taken and killed by a dingo while the family were camping in the outback in 1980, and she was wrongfully convicted of murder because nobody believed her.

(I'm born after 1980, so my summary is woeful, but last week a toddler was mauled by a dingo while camping so)	-8
philosophy	Postcolony_Of_Bats	">It might help to be more specific. Even Scandinavian countries rank very highly in terms of economic freedom.

True, but economic freedom rankings contain a lot of noise; both major ""economic freedom"" rankings include categories based on lack of corruption and rule of law, for example, which aren't intrinsically measures of being more individualist or communitarian. So ""economic freedom"" rankings don't really directly or clearly measure exactly the question of how communitarian a society is. Even if we were to accept for the sake of argument that they did, it still doesn't offer robust support for your position. There's not a remotely absolute relationship between gdp per capita and economic freedom indexes, and there isn't even really a correlation at all between economic growth and economic freedom rankings. 

>No, but in this analogy the prison is a man-made construct therefore not analogous to poverty- which would be our natural condition. I would ask whether someone who works and labors to cultivate food should be forced to share that food with one who is hungry. If not, they would be limiting the terms under which others can avoid starvation. If so, they don't really own their labor. 

The prison wasn't intended to be analogous to poverty, but rather to our overall economic structure, which *is* a man-made construct. More specifically, it is a man-made construct which has allowed some people relatively complete control over others' access to sustenance, and thus allowed those people to compel others into making decisions on fundamentally unfree terms. The same way the prisoner must meet the demands of their captors or starve, people without control over the means of production must (with a few generally impractical exceptions) enter into some form wage labor arrangement or starve. The point is that neither really any viable option other than to suggest the terms being offered to them. When we talk about the choice being unfree, it wasn't really to make a moral judgment in that assessment itself, but rather to reject the argument out that their decision to enter in to the arrangement can be taken as proof that the arrangement isn't exploitative. This argument is erroneous because the workers have essentially no viable options other than entering into the arrangement. Workers making a ""choice"" to enter into wage labor arrangements does not prove these arrangements are abstractly fair and desirable, given that workers are essentially coerced into making them with the threat of death by starvation; they show only that wage labor arrangements are fairer and more desirable than almost certain death. Whether the choice ultimately is unfair or undesirable is an altogether separate debate, but the idea that it is ostensible a ""free"" choice cannot be tenably used to suggest it is fair and desirable.

On that note, and in terms of the question of whether people should be forced to share the food they produce, I think that's the harder question, because I think it's at least fair to argue that anyone forced to share the fruits (literally, in this case) of their labor doesn't own that labor. However, the vast majority of people under capitalistic systems definitely don't really own their labor, either. So the questions to be asked are whether there is a tenable and coherent system imaginable in which people do, in fact, own their labor, and if not what is the fairest and most desirable system in which people, unfortunately, lack full ownership of their labor. In terms of the former question, I'm not really sure. In terms of the latter, I think guaranteeing basic sustenance for all people is more fair and desirable than further enriching the already wealthy. 

>First, we are talking about the scale of production. Second, you should read the Leonard E. Read's account of what is required to make a pencil in the link I provided. The vast economic infrastructure involved in mass producing something so small is almost inflatable and requires the cooperation of individuals who do not even know that they are participating in the process. Rather, they are each simply pursuing their own ends.

I am familiar with *I, Pencil*. Read's account describes how pencils are made in a modern capitalist economy, but it doesn't really prove that this is the only or most efficient way in which pencils can be made. (Read also disingenuously neglects how much of the infrastructure involved, from publicly maintained forests to the education and training of many of the involved workers, hinges upon government intervention, but that's a sideline to the point we're debating here.) I want to see actual, hard evidence that free market pencil production is more efficient than pencil production under other economic systems."	5
philosophy	PokebongGo	That's a great idea. I haven't heard of a better idea for a tattoo. Where do you have it?	5
philosophy	unknown_poo	"Exactly. The meditation upon death is a central practice in many pre-modern spiritual and religious systems. What it does, if we were to understand it according to psychological categories, is that it reconceptualizes material phenomena from permanent to impermanent. When we are heedless, the mind begins to conceptualize phenomena as permanent. This describes the metaphysical concept of Ignorance or aviddya in Buddhism, for instance. This is when we become dominated by comfort and chase after pleasant sensations, forming attachment with them too, attempting to make them also permanent. And thus therein is the pursuit of happiness, as something always out of reach. But by meditating upon death, we can retain the underlying perception of physical phenomena as impermanent, especially as it relates to how we conceptualize humans. 


Much of the shock and trauma that comes from the death of a loved one has to do with our underlying paradigm of the world no longer making sense. That the organizing principle, the principle of permanence, upon which our conception of reality is predicated becomes unhinged. This traumatic effect then leads to rumination and the mind's attempt at reassembling a coherent concept of reality. Meditating on death is how the mind anticipates this, and perhaps can attain an organizing principle that includes impermanence, and so one's reality becomes a coherent projection of this."	-7

philosophy	Neverlookidly	I dunno if this is along the same lines but if it's a death I know is coming sooner or later (ailing old family member, pet getting slower and slower) I like to grieve before hand. Spend more special time with them, write them a letter to express what they meant to you and that you will miss them so much. (Or say it, though I find that too difficult to the point literally wouldn't be able to understand what I would be trying to say). They know it's coming just as well if not more so than you do and it will mean a lot more to both of you. They say grief is for the living but by showing it this way before it's too late creates extremely meaningful moments and it dampens the blow when it does happen. You give yourself peace by being honest and them peace in knowing how you loved them. Now I won't lie this can be EXTREMELY difficult, you'll cry, they'll cry, or in a pets case be confused by your sudden upset. But it's better than not, for me at least.	6

For practical reasons, stoicism does not give the answers to grief after the loss. I would say that a walk down memory lane might help in easing the pain until you are finally able to see that the grief is created by the self and it can be let go with no judgment.

The reminding/preparing for loss process.
What exactly is proposed? Just reminding yourself that anyone could die tomorrow? It seems an unnecessary thing to do because for most people their death is unlikely and most of the grieving people do is as a result of an unlikely event. 
IE people do not generally grieve as long for a 90 year old that has died because it is more likely and people are prepared.
I think what the stoics do is what everyone else does except they also prepare for the very unlikely events, which many people deem unnecessary.

Also if you are prepared to lose something at every moment does that not intact contradict attachment.

Stoicism is to not take anything, even life, for granted. Because you never know how tomorrow will be.

It is inevitable, it can be devastating, however if you mentally prepare for the absolute worst it hits you with less force than if you ignore it and respond with shock when it appears.

Just because you couldn't doesn't mean it's unreasonable. I spent eight hours in a hospital watching my sister slowly die on her 19th birthday due to a freak accident. My outward emotional reaction was muted, demonstrated by the number of nurses and doctors who complimented me for staying strong for my mother who was barely keeping it together. The same thing repeated at her funeral a few days later. 

I loved my sister greatly, and her death was painful. But after coping with the lost of my best friend to suicide a few years earlier, I learned how to approach death and grief without letting it crush me.

Also, really seems like you didn't read the article. Stoicism isn't about stifling or suppressing anything, it's about training yourself to accept the emotional response without letting it drive you to taking irrational, kneejerk action. For death and loss specifically, you achieve this by constantly acknowledging the ephemeral nature of everything. You either suffer the death of your loved ones or they suffer yours. Ignoring this fact only causes unbearable floods of emotion for you when the former occurs. Consistent meditation on this fact (frequently referred to as negative visualization) allows you to truly appreciate the time you have without breaking underneath the weight of inevitable loss."	-14
philosophy	ModestMariner	"I never had anyone very close to me die until my grandmother passed away about a month ago.

Another thing that came to mind while I was working through this was the Japanese concept of transience or as they call it ""mono no aware"". In other words, things have meaning in the fact that they don't last forever. A milkshake doesn't last forever, all stories have an end, movies only last an hour or two, etc... but we enjoy them all the same. The same goes for life, and the time we spend with others. Eventually it comes to an end, but we enjoy that time all the same. And when that time ends, we will be sad that it ends, of course, but we can also be happy that it happened."	9

Because they should not be. Because if they were there would never be any progress. Because they are in charge of coming up with the new ideas. Layman political philosophy is stuck decades to centuries in the past.

>We should make sure that academics better represents the views of the public.

No, we should make sure the the public better understands why these academics are thinking these new ideas and why they should be adopted.

People who ask these questions diverged from the consensus-timeline-of-ideas some time ago and now they do not understand why the rest of humanity is not thinking like them.

For example, if you disagree that all humans should have equal rights, then you can start asking questions about who should be on top and who should be at the bottom. But such questions are not interesting to somebody who agrees that all humans should have equal rights.

When you confront death head-on, it can break you down. But you can learn to deal with it by training your mind. It becomes like exposure therapy - you let yourself go down those dark paths in order to find the truth that every human tries to hide from: that you and everyone you love will die. If let yourself, you will gradually find an acceptance which leads to something like Stoicism. I don't imagine it will work for everyone, but yes, this is healthy. Much more healthy than being overcome with anxiety and breakdown every time someone passes away.	2

philosophy	isolde123	"“Instead, if anything, by actively reminding ourselves of our child’s mortality – even as we delight in kissing her goodnight – we render all the more salient what is most precious about her existence.”

I agree with the idea that by reminding ourselves of the transience of all things, including those we love, we can cultivate a greater gratitude for their existence. But I don’t agree that by doing so, it follows that we necessarily have reduced emotional responses.  It may be just the opposite- by contemplating how things are transient, we may have heightened emotions.

Additionally, there is a necessarily performative aspect to emotionality, since we cannot open up a person’s skull to check what emotions they are “really” experiencing (at least outside a research lab). Whether a person chooses to show their emotions externally or not to do so is not necessarily an accurate way to assess their actual feelings either way.  There are plenty of reasons someone may choose to display an emotion he or she may not feel; or may choose to withhold Public display of emotion they do feel.

So being prescriptive either way about how someone should grieve does not make sense unless it serves a performative role within the culture or is useful for the individual. Cultural norms may dictate what external signs of emotionality may be generally expected. The signs may be more or less important for an individual to adhere to, depending on how highly the culture values the ritual of mourning."	13
philosophy	peds4x4	"Not a Stoic but have always thought grief is essentially a selfish emotion . People are grieving because some part of their life has changed. But everyone feels it differently so I would never condone someone else for what they are feeling.
I did not cry at my fathers bedside when he passed away but when I knelt in front of my mum and gave her the news and she broke down , then I did, in seeing the pain on my mother's face."	-9
philosophy	TaupeRanger	"I'm sorry for your recent loss, but even aside from the gatekeeping (""unnatural"" in what way?) you are just empirically wrong about your own behavior. Surely you understand that there are many ways to change one's future behavior. There absolutely \*is\* a way for you to avoid ""balling your eyes out"". Whether you make an attempt to pursue this type of emotional control is a personal decision, but to say that ""nothing can stop me"" from it is just plain old wrong. The Stoics did not believe in avoiding human emotion - you seem to think they are like the Vulcans from Star Trek or something...reread the article and see if you can come away with a better understanding."	-1
philosophy	RetinalFlashes	"Agreed u/ayemann. When my grandpa died, I didn't cry at all. I thought something was wrong with me. Looking back, I now understand that it was a relief he had died, because of his years of suffering. I was happy that he was in a better place, wherever that was (I'm atheist so I don't really believe in an afterlife).

When my grandmother died, I cried probably 2 nights a week for a couple years because of the unexpected way she died so suddenly and I couldn't be there. I missed being able to be there for her death and it tore me apart. I was still glad she was in a better place, but it affected me differently, psychologically.

Both of those ways are perfectly normal ways to grieve.
We can't gatekeep that not crying is unnatural. Those who say that just haven't had the experience of not crying after a death of a loved one. And that's fine too. They just need to learn not to judge what they don't understand."	-1

philosophy	panekroom	Wow! This is an exceptionally great way of saying this.	3
philosophy	Ey_Yo_Gurl	"This was really interesting and helped me understand my own reaction to loss and death. I had a close friend of mine die unexpectedly when I was in high school and it nearly drove me to suicide because I wasn't mentally equipped to deal with the grief. It made me question just about everything in my life, and I didn't want to accept a world that was so completely unfair. I ditched my religion, dropped out of my high school, and ended up in a pretty dark place for a long time. 

Somewhere along the way I made the decision to never let the loss of a loved one affect me like that again. I accepted death was inevitable, could happen unexpectedly, and that every day could be the last I get to spend with someone. My relationship to loss and death are much healthier now as a result, and I don't find myself completely broken down when someone I care about dies. It's not like I don't feel sadness or shed any tears. I just don't find myself completely despondent or angry that the world has taken something from me. 

Sadness and grief are natural, but letting them consume you is not. From reading the article, it sounds like an objective of the Stoics was to suggest a path to a healthy relationship with death and loss and not one marked by unhealthy despondency. It's not about suppressing anything. It's about fortifying your own natural defense mechanisms so you're able to endure, process, and move on from even the most unexpected loss. This is healthy and not impossible or unrealistic as a lot of people seem to be suggesting.

philosophy	dhizzy123	So did FDR	0
philosophy	Dead_Poets_Honor	"I'm sorry for your loss. Nothing can make it easy. 

I would like to point out that a stoic doesn't respond to death, they prepare for it.

The difference between a stoic and others when facing death, is that stoics have faced that death every day, often for many years before it occurs. They make peace with the logic and understanding of the physical world, where all things must someday die, their loved ones and themselves included. 

It is a re-framing of death. Where death strikes most people as sudden and unexpected, certainly as something they're unprepared for, when death occurs to a stoic's loved one, they have already mentally processed and come to terms with the death, reasoned through their emotions and are as prepared as one can be for such a devastating occurrence. 

A stoic will still see that red mailbox at the end of their drive everyday, and think fondly of how their loved one always got the mail from it, it's just that a stoic came to terms long ago with the fact that some day that would stop. 

It's very much a pre-grieving that occurs. I think it is very healthy because it allows you to contemplate death from a logical perspective when you aren't so clouded by emotions from a recent death. It can even help you learn about yourself and grow as a person, because it really helps put into perspective which relationships are truly important to you and decipher how you ought to be spending your time on what you care about."	11

philosophy	NoNarcsJustMarx	The book has a very different meaning behind it compared to the movie. De sade was trying to get rid of the restraints of morals by taking enlightenment ideas founded upon hobbean materialism to what I believe the logical conclusion should be. He did this by pushing human sexuality to the extremes in his books (and his life). In salo the director was ironically doing the exact opposite with the same story. Sade believed that those who are rich and powerful enough should have no restraints on their behavior, as might=right. The director was against this and I *believe* was a gay communist (I know at least gay). He was trying to show the problems with the excesses of the rich and the abuse of money and power. I think he chose de sades 120 days because it is an amazing example of the excess of the bourgeois. I feel like the book can be an excellent reminder of what we are at our core. Cuel animals held back only by the institutions we have made up and put in place. The movie I feel helps bring light to the problems of power and the issues of excess.	9

If a woman back then had 8 children and 6 die, there is no point in spiraling into grief or you'd never come out.  Stoicism was the only way to keep your life together.

When my Grampa died, it was sad to see him go, but he was 91 so it wasn't unexpected.  I managed to keep a smile on my face and talked about the life he led, not the life lost.  I only got misty-eyed when one of my Marine family members saluted his casket, but otherwise I wanted it to be about my love for him and the beautiful person he was.  Histrionics would seem disingenuous as you can't live like a 91 year old isn't standing with one foot through death's door.  

I went to the funeral for a 4 year old who randomly dropped dead a few months ago.  I could not suppress the grief I felt and wept openly.  It was a life cut short for seemingly no reason (there is still no official cause of death other than her heart just stopped beating) so to expect stoicism and stifled emotion is unreasonable.

Or perhaps I'm saying that individual rationality is a fiction and that rationality is really only a collective property of a system where our individual biases are arranged so as to cancel each other out, as in science and mathematics.

Perhaps our innate human biases, particularly in group/out group bias and confirmation bias, means that placing ourselves in some ""rationality group"" necessarily *compromises* our ability to be rational. Studies have shown that practice can help us avoid *logical fallacies*, but it seems that training has no significant effect in curbing various *cognitive bias*. So individual rationality indeed appears to be something of an illusion.

It uses perception, inference, comparison, and testimony of experts as valid sources of knowledge. Interestingly for an orthodox school of Indian philosophy, early iterations of Nyaya didn't mention deities, so they were probably non-theistic or agnostic. They focused pretty heavily on epistemology, and mention that suffering is caused by improper or incomplete knowledge and that liberation comes from getting true knowledge.

* Since objects are only ever what ever they are you can not derive an ""ought"" from an ""is"" and therefore there is no universal morality system.

You would need to derive a need to do something from something physical which is impossible because things are nothing more than themselves.

Self-efficacy and efficiency can only be brought about in a student when we replace learning for some outside reward, or punishment, with learning for the sake of learning. We utilize external control psychology to get kids to learn but all it ever does is teach them to memorize material for the tests, which can be done for those who are mentally/emotionally capable, but the problem with lower socioeconomic classes is that they do worse because a lack of self confidence that permeates their lives outside of the school, which is something a school cannot fix.

philosophy	ManticJuice	">Are you saying calculation can explain qualia, but not the experience of qualia?

I'm saying that calculation can explain the presence of different qualia in experience, not the presence of experience itself. ""X calculation gives rise to Y qualia"" makes sense, but ""X objective physical process gives rise to subjective experience itself"" requires further justification.

>Which of those are not independent? 

None of them, obviously, my point is that there is no explanation of *seeing* itself, not that there's no explanation of *what* is being seen; it isn't a question of appearance vs reality in perception, it's a question of how physical processes give rise to subjective experience in the first place.

>That's not what I said. I mean, literally. You're leaving words out.

You literally said exactly this:

""I don't, however, see how one could even start to figure out or investigate why one pile of matter has a conscious experience and another almost identical pile doesn't""

Please explain what I'm leaving out. If it's the ""almost"" that's tripping you up, then simply substitute it back into what I said. There are no ""almost identical"" piles of matter where one is conscious and the other is not, because ""almost identical"" is broadly construed as physical and causal structure, not just being ""almost identical"" in a narrowly construed computational sense.

>No, I mean the same way you do.

Which is not at all, empirically speaking. There is only inference, and if you want to verify which computations are conscious and which are not, and your verification of that is whether or not a being is conscious, then your circular definition gives you no way to verify which are and are not, since you cannot directly test for consciousness. If ""conscious computations are involved in the computations of conscious beings"" then you cannot test for consciousness except by assuming the being is conscious, at which point you aren't making a meaningful test but operating upon your original assumptions - it doesn't add any extra explanation or differentiation between conscious and non-conscious subjects.

>I disagree. And when you disagree, you don't justify that disagreement. I present a logical argument, and you either say ""I don't believe that's right"" or you tell me the logic doesn't follow without saying (at least, not clearly enough) which step doesn't follow.

I have repeatedly stated that derivation of subjectivity from objectivity is not possible, by virtue of the fact that we cannot observe a causal relationship but only a correlative one. Saying ""X physical process *causes* Y subjective experience"" is not legitimate, beacuse we cannot observe the other's subjective experience to verify this relation, plus it remains only a correlation, not an actual causal one, as there is no causal mechanism elaborated, simply a statement of ""brute fact"". You keep repeating that computations ""are"" conscious experience, but when I ask you how any physical process which is not inherently conscious can change slightly and become conscious you shrug and say ""we'll find out eventually"". I simply do not see how any objective fact or process can in principle derive a causal explanation for subjectivity, in large part because all objective observation and reasoning is rooted in subjectivity. All our theorising, all our experimentation derives from our experience as subjective beings, as embodied, perceiving entities. As such, any attempt to explain subjectivity from objective facts is doomed to failure, as the explanandum is already present in the explanation - all objective facts already contain a kernel of subjectivity by virtue of the fact that objective observation and reasoning occurs through the medium of subjective experience. Abstraction away from this eliminates any possibility of explaining consciousness, which is why physicalism, the arch-objectivist explanation of reality, completely fails to account for consciousness at all, because, in abstracting away from subjectivity as an ""obscuring feature"" of reality, it undercuts its own explanation by removing the very thing which makes objective observation possible - the presence of subjectivity. We cannot explain subjectivity through objectivity because all objectivity presupposes a subject to perceive and reason - we cannot explain something when the thing to be explained is part of the explanation. So either we efface subjectivity entirely and obtain a total objectivity which is pure abstraction and not rooted in the reality of our being perceiving subjective entities, or else we accept the presence of subjectivity as a primary fact and reason from there, accepting that we cannot derive subjectivity from objectivity by virtue of the latter's origins in the former. This is what panpsychism does for example, as it takes subjectivity to be primary rather than derivative of objectivity, as all objectivity which we possess is in fact derived from subjectivity - there are no facts which do not have their origins in our observations and reasonings therefrom. (If you haven't read it already, [this article](https://aeon.co/essays/the-blind-spot-of-science-is-the-neglect-of-lived-experience) addresses this point nicely. Written by an astrophysicist, a theoretical physicist and a philosopher, no less; this isn't just the fantasy of philosophers, but the reality of the current science.)

>As for the credit I give to panpsychism, I'm coming to believe that you believe consciousness cannot be caused. It must therefore be an intrinsic aspect that isn't caused by anything. If that's the case, then of course none of my arguments about how computation causes consciousness will make any sense.

Of course consciousness cannot be ""caused"" in a basic sense - it is a fundamental property of matter. This isn't magic any more than the charge of an electron is not ""caused"" by anything - it is simply a fundamental property of matter. Complex *kinds* of consciousness, such as our own, can be caused by complex arrangements of matter, and this may very well involve computations of the sort you are discussing, but this is not what ""generates"" consciousness, because basic consciousness is primary and ""uncaused"" as a fundamental property of matter - the arragements of matter ""cause"" complex *forms* of consciousness, but consciousness *itself* is not caused in this way, because it is primary, a fundamental property of matter, like charge, but an intrinsic rather than extrinsic one."	1
philosophy	ManticJuice	">You must be reading a different paper than I am. I'm talking about this: cogprints.org/7150/1/10.1.1.83.5248.pdf

From the paper:

""The aim of the Chinese room example was to try to show this by showing that as soon as we put something into the system that really does have intentionality (a man), and we program him with the formal program, you can see that the formal program carries no additional intentionality. **It adds nothing, for example, to a man's ability to understand Chinese.**""

The whole point of the argument is to show there is no understanding in syntactic symbol manipulation, that a mind which lacks understanding of a thing does not gain understanding of it through a complex system of instructions relating to it. Formal programs do not carry intentionality because they are solely syntactic, not semantic structures. Arguing whether or not the room as a whole understands is the systems argument, not Searle's original point.

> No, the system argument is the explanation of why he might be wrong. Searle isn't making the system argument; his detractors are.

I'm aware, which is why presenting Searle's original argument as if it's about the room's understanding is erroneous.

>You say this with such assurance, but with so little justification. Can you explain why Mrs Wang is conscious when embodied as meat but not when embodied as silicon?

Mrs Wang is a complex of trillions of cells in the body as well as a complex of neurons which form the most complex structure we are aware of in existence - the brain. A room has no such complexity of arrangement or density of components. Once again, at no point have I said that that machine consciousness is impossible, I'm denying the possibility that the room is a conscious mind capable of understanding Chinese. Are you really asserting that rooms are conscious minds meaningfully similar to our own?

>Again, an assertion without explanation, let alone debatable justification.

At what point does symbol manipulation give rise to intentionality? I have intentionality because I possess subjective experience as a perceiving mind, so you will have to explain how symbol manipulation in an unconscious system gives rise to a subject which can possess intentionality; you're the one making the exceptional claim, not me. Again, from the paper:

""...the formal symbol manipulations by themselves don't have any intentionality; they are quite meaningless; they aren't even symbol manipulations, since the symbols don't symbolize anything. In thelinguistic jargon, they have only a syntax but no semantics. Such intentionality as computers appear to have is solely in the minds ofthose who program them and those who use them, those who send in theinput and those who interpret the output.""

If you disagree, you will have to explain how unperceiving number-crunching gives rise to a subject which perceives and thus is capable of intentionality. Disagreement with Searle presupposes CTM, so I feel like perhaps the thought experiment generates an impasse.

>Why is the room not an embodiment of Mrs Wang's mind, precisely?

Because minds are more than computations - you're operating on the assumption that minds are just Turing Machines and thus instantiable by computational systems, which is debateable; living organisms have an evolutionary history and are not isolated systems created *ex nihilo*, and this embodiment and history directly impacts what goes on in the system. This article is a good treatment of this issue - https://aeon.co/ideas/the-body-is-the-missing-link-for-truly-intelligent-machines

>2) Premise: your thoughts[...] are caused by the processes performed by your neurons[...] in your brain, i.e., the computations your neurons are performing.

This is an unjustified premise. Neuroscience observes neural-mental correlates, not a causal link. This is precisely why the hard problem exists. You have to provide an explanation of *how* neural calculations cause mental events, you cannot simply say that they do - that isn't an explanation. Either they are identical, at which point the question arises how objective calculation is ""the same as"" subjective experience (and isn't really explanatory in a meaningful way), or else you are required to explain the causal relationship, *how* precisely objective calculations give rise to subjective experience.

>That's not what I said.

You said - ""The computations experienced by the subject are the ones that are computing what the subject experiences.""

You'll have to explain how that is meaningfully different from - ""Computations which are conscious are computations involved in consciousness"". ""Computations which are conscious"" just means ""computations experienced by the subject"", I don't see how I'm misrepresenting you here.

>It's an excellent definition.

It's absolutely not. Definitions are required to be in terms other than the thing being defined, you can't define conscious computations as computations that are conscious any more than you can define red balls as balls that are red. It's a tautology, not a definition.

>You criticize me for being unable to use computation to prove the existence of consciousness, yet you'll freely assert that stuff made out of the same kind of matter as you are, behaving in very similar ways, cannot be conscious.

I have literally never said that. I'm not sure where you're getting this from. There are no physically identical but unconscious bits of matter. Unless you're talking about rooms versus humans, which, although made of the ""same kind of matter"" are arranged very differently, at which point, of course the consciousness will be different. Are you asserting that rooms and humans have the same sort of conscious experience? Behaviour broadly construed is a very low-resolution measure of consciousness, it doesn't examine what is going on internally to a system so isn't a very good way to determine the degree of consciousness of an entity, plus ""behaving in very similar ways"" isn't exactly true for Searle's room and a human, given that Searle's room can only ""speak Chinese"" and not navigate an environment, imagine possible scenarios and so on. Once a system can do that, it will have quite a different material arrangement, at which point it is not so different from a human, so again, I have never asserted that ""stuff made out of the same kind of matter as you are, behaving in very similar ways, cannot be conscious"", this is a fabrication; rooms and brains are not ""the same kind of matter"".

>I'm explaining what ""explanatory power"" is.

Right, well you also said: ""That's panpsychism, if you didn't catch it"", so you'll still have to explain that.

>And yet you repeatedly assert that you know its cause and that certain patterns of matter that behave conscious aren't. 

Its ""cause"" is being a fundamental property of matter. There are no ""patterns of matter that behave conscious"" but aren't, all matter is conscious, what I'm talking about is certain *kinds* of consciousness e.g. the kind of subjective experience which allows one to possess intentionality and thus understand Chinese semantically. A room ""is conscious"" in the sense that its matter possesses consciousness as a fundamental property but it is not arranged to nearly the complexity and component-density as exists in the human brain which seems to be required for subjective experience in the manner which we undergo. If you're really claiming that rooms are conscious and capable of understanding I can only assume you're asserting pancomputationalism and thus a form of panpscyhism yourself.

>In spite of the fact that you're sitting there assuming I'm conscious without knowing anything about what I'm made out of.

Well, I'm assuming you're human and thus of a similar physical arrangement as myself. Am I wrong?

>And yet when I present you something that's very similar and could (in theory) do everything I'm doing, you assert that it isn't conscious.

But it's *not* ""very similar"". A room is not ""very similar"" to a human being. It's only ""very similar"" if you narrowly construe a human being as merely a computational process, but that is an extremely narrow characterisation of what we actually are - it ignores the vast majority of our physical form. You're abstracting away from the actual being in order to possess a clean model which then appears to be applicable to nearly anything, like a room, but this is only because it is an abstract model which eliminates the ""messy"" reality of emobodied existence. Human beings are not simply calculators riding around in a meat suit, [cognition is spread throughout the body and the environment](https://www.iep.utm.edu/embodcog/) and taking the brain and the calculations within to be the sole seat of the ""soul"" of human subjectivity is an ontological hangover from Descartes' dualism. If you take the actual situation, it is obvious that a human being is not ""very similar"" to a room, only when you ignore the majority of the actual entities in question can you eliminate the difference and declare them ""very similar"", but this similarity is only in a very narrow and abstract sense, divorced from the reality of the situation.

>I have no idea how you went from my statement ""of course not all computations are conscious just like not all computations are Microsoft Word"" to ""are you claiming Word is conscious?""

Because if I asked which computations are conscious (since presumably they are not all conscious), and you replied that Word is made of computation, this implies that all consciousness is made of computation by default i.e. it's not an answer. The only way this analogy is a meaningful response to my question is if we assume that all computations are conscious, therefore ""all computations are Word programs"", which obviously doesn't make sense. It was a confusing response on your part which is why my response seems a non-sequitur - I was trying to make sense of your own somewhat irrelevant analogy."	24

philosophy	Earnesto101	"Brilliant!

I too admire the sentiment of Socrates that “I know that I know nothing”. I think it’s one of the best philosophical tools to keep us honest. I like to think that it keeps us fearful of the power in knowledge, playing with knowledge and ideas can create much more fire than people normally appreciate.

I also share deep sentiments about the work of science. Bertrand Russell once wrote something about how scientists have come closer to the ‘truth’ in the last few centuries than philosophers ever have. That’s always stuck with me, but to be honest it’s only relevant if we stay divided as scientists and philosophers. 
Science has good methods, but with philosophical underpinnings does it not?!
They do well to keep each other in check, as you say.

To agree with you even more, I resonate on the need to understand why things, like religious ideology, do take root even if they are full of nonsense.
I grew up with quite a rationalistic mind, like I think many do, and it’s only now being a bit older that I’m branching out to consider the actual reason some things prevail.
It’s much more interesting than labelling things as ‘right’ and ‘wrong’! 

Something that might interest you on this front. Have you heard of David Chalmers? You may be interested in reading his paper on ‘facing up to the problem of consciousness’.
As far as I’m aware, it’s had one of the biggest impact on the debate of consciousness. It’s where the term ‘the hard problem of consciousness’ became well defined.
It’s a little beyond my scope, but from what I’ve read, Chalmers suggests that our current philosophical and scientific tools simply aren’t good enough for investigating the mystery of consciousness, and we need entirely new base methods. Very interesting.
I think it fits in line with your philosophies about other perspectives, and whether our current ones really are the best way to find the truth.
Anyway, you should be able to access it online somewhere.

philosophy	Harha	"Could one argue, that even our own mind is kinda quantized in the spatial and thus also time domain, if we assume that everything one person is, spawns from the configuration of matter that is the human brain? Somehow this quantized blob of matter just perceives the surrounding reality as one seemingly clear entity, mostly thanks to the quick communication inside the brain and relatively short distances each signal has to travel.

So, objective reality acts as a state machine, and our mind has evolved to use this state machine to keep track of previously perceived states, using very vague snapshots. Which is why our subjective reality can be much much more than the objective reality.

Thus in the objective domain, there is no time in the sense that there is no need to keep track of previous states. There is just this instant. We are a complex configuration of quantum field values in the objective domain that has evolved to take snapshots of its own subjective instant.

This thought obviously goes deeper than this, for example, I didn't really dive into the fact that the snapshots I'm talking about each consist of samples that were sampled at different locations in the objective realm in both spatial and time axes.

I'm sorry, I'm not a philosopher, but this is my quick afternoon conclusion of how things could be. I try to avoid these thoughts, because I hate feeling anxious.

 The important thing though is that all observer DO agree on chronological orderings of 2 events inside each other's light cones. So causality is never harmed because FTL is impossible, but it fundamentally breaks with our intuitive sense of universal time."	1
philosophy	eddywhere	"You aren't being ignorant at all! And as always in science and philosophy, I consider you more wise for thinking so. I've always agreed with Socrates and Lao Tzu in that sense, that those who claim to ""know everything"" are really the ignorant ones. Which is very relevant to your quantum physics quote. I think it really holds true for all physics and philosophy. In math, there are ""truths,"" because we create them. But in nature, we have a lot to learn. I know I certainly do.

I agree though that we are doing a great job. I tend to ask questions like these and try to push the limit because I think that it's fun, but it also can lead me into discussions that end up teaching me a lot. But, yes, humanity has learned so much through science, and I value all that knowledge immensely.

I only know quantum mechanics from podcasts and wikipedia mostly (what an age we live in), so most of my knowledge is rudimentary. I work in education, and I wanted to have a basic understanding so I could introduce students to concepts like entanglement without them knowing they were actually learning quantum science, so when they were introduced properly later, they would say, ""hey, I already know about that!"" Either that or pique their interest to have them start exploring the science themselves. But once I started learning, I got hooked. It gets too technical for me very frequently, but I try my best.

I wouldn't say I necessarily think about philosophy differently since I started diving deeper into physics, but if anything, learning about quantum reminds me how little we know and how much we know at the same time, which is similar to the sentiment you were getting at.

I very much agree that the mechanics humans have theorized about the way we experience the universe have been essential for our scientific progress. Most of our greatest discoveries were made utilizing these systems, so you're right that it's more reasonable to approach science that way.

So I'm not sure if it is worth thinking about how inanimate objects or other living things experience the universe, however it is fun for me to push myself to imagine if there could be a way in which that line of inquiry might help humans progress. I think if it were something worth exploring, the reason might be that we are possibly missing something by always approaching the problems from the perspective of humans. Perhaps the system of mechanics we use to categorize the way we subjectively perceive the universe clouds our potential to see new things. 

That's why I value the marriage of philosophy and science so much. I used to be more skeptical that science would ever really help us uncover the true mysteries of human consciousness. But look at the strides in neuroscience alone in the past couple decades. Sure, we still have a lot to learn, but I'm amazed at how much we've uncovered. I've had to study and self-teach for thousands of hours to keep up with the advancements of science since I finished school. 

Now I believe strongly that both the fields of Philosophy and Science would do well to be constantly checked by each other. I think science is moving a lot faster than philosophy, so I try to do my part to question physicists. To me, it's equally likely that physics and quantum mechanics will help us uncover even more mysteries about consciousness and human nature as it is likely that philosophy and constant questioning will help us uncover even more mysteries about the universe and quantum science. 

Similar to what we were saying, the more I learn, the less I feel like I know. I haven't believed in God or magic since I was 5 years old, but in the past few years I've been starting to see the *function* of imagining those things. It's not that we will discover ""magic,"" it's that the line of inquiry we might take while philosophizing about such things might take us to places that we wouldn't have otherwise explored, constrained by the science we believe disproves any such things.

One of the smartest scientists of all time, Einstein, talked about ""spooky action at a distance,"" and now we have observed quantum entanglement in action.

As Einstein said: ""Quantum mechanics is very impressive. But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing. The theory produces a good deal but hardly brings us closer to the secret of the Old One. I am at all events convinced that He does not play dice.""

Since then, we've proven a lot of those theories, and shown that quantum mechanics *does* roll dice; and in fact, quantum makes the best dice, and produces the only true mathematical randomness that I am aware of, which is the foundation for some aspects of quantum computing.

But the physicist I am wary of is the one who takes that and says, ""Einstein's old one is dead, quantum mechanics is truth and that's that.""

philosophy	snfgrf	"True materialism doesn't rule out the possibility that ""life"" continues after death.

My thought process:

- Personality is a function of the brain. There are countless documented cases of brain damage leading to (sometimes) radical changes in the personality of a patient.

- We wouldn't say that a person experiencing such a shift in personality has lost his consciousness. So personality and consciousness are more or less separate entities.

- Huge leap?

- Many materialists (esp. atheists) think that death is the end of life. If consciousness isn't linked to a specific person and requires a functioning brain, why would it not be possible to ""wake up"" in a new body without having any memory of past ""experiences"" once brain death occurs?

I'd like to add that I don't really want to believe in this possibility. I don't like life so much that I would want it to continue, but a materialist worldview just does not rule it out by itself.

philosophy	eugenejwallace	Thanks. I’ve actually done a quick update to include internal causes and a couple of examples.  However thanks to the both of you, I can now see that there is no explanation of how internal causes play into the wider arguments and examples I put forth. I will definitely be revising this blog post with more scrutiny to include such an explanation. It will likely follow /u/fixedsys999 examples, explaining how the environment is processed through our genetics and learned experience. Also maybe an explanation of how bodily motivations come into play (such as hunger).	1

philosophy	Ghawk134	“... there is never ‘now’, since it immediately moves to the past, into our memory.” This was the line where the argument became garbage. First, there must be a now or else we cannot have any perceptions of reality. Second, just because the present now slips instantly to the past doesn’t mean it isn’t replaced by a new now. Also, while the timespan of the present is certainly infinitesimal, anyone who has taken a high school physics course surely knows that instantaneous calculations can be performed, for example on a ball at time t with some initial conditions. Also, saying there is no real definition of the ordering of events based on some vague relativistic argument is also ignorant, since the spacetime interval serves exactly that purpose. This guy just made some assumptions based on a flawed perception of reality and came up empty.	-3

I agree with you that’s it’s reasonable for us to label my interpretation of ‘objective reality’ as just another subjective inference. In the philosophical sense, I don’t think we can ever truly know which way is up and which way is down in the universe.

I have a limited understanding of quantum physics, but I do appreciate that we have all sort of effects like entanglement, and quantum uncertainty that are basically impossible for humans to interpret and understand. Doesn’t the quote go along the lines of “He who claims to understand quantum physics, doesn’t understand it at all” I’m not sure who by.
That puts a whole lot of holes in what I’d like to consider as my version of ‘objective’. It shows that humans really have rudimentary cognitive machinery that isn’t designed for things beyond the Newtonian physics of catching cricket balls!
I think that makes it perfectly reasonable that there are interpretations of reality that we will never experience. So what’s the answer?

I can’t fault any of your commitments to appreciating that there might indeed be different mechanics governing the different perspectives by trees and rocks, for instance. 

But I do think there is a ‘most reasonable’ way for us to interpret all this existential uncertainty. It falls down to the fact that we are humans, with definable psychological and physical abilities. Granted that we haven’t fully understood these (but we’re not doing badly eh?).
I’d hate to sound like a logical positivist, but if we only ever have this set of experiences then what’s the point of imagining ourselves into the place of a rock?

The way we can have any hope at objectivity is by fully understanding our capabilities, and using that information to make accurate, reliable predications of what will happen around us in the future.

Maybe I’m rooted in too much scientism to appreciate the problem?

In short, I agree that everything is fair game to be labelled as a subjective interpretation. But if we don’t quantify the way in which we make subjective interpretations, then we’ll never have any axiom to stand on.

Let me know if I’m being ignorant! Thanks for your thought so far :)"	16

You must be reading a different paper than I am. I'm talking about this: cogprints.org/7150/1/10.1.1.83.5248.pdf

> Searle's original argument is not a systems argument,

No, the system argument is the explanation of why he might be wrong. Searle isn't making the system argument; his detractors are.

> Sure, but neurons collectively make up a mind which is capable of understanding, a room doesn't.

You say this with such assurance, but with so little justification. Can you explain why Mrs Wang is conscious when embodied as meat but not when embodied as silicon?

> The machine does not possess intentionality whatsoever, thus does not understand.

Again, an assertion without explanation, let alone debatable justification. :-)

> Only when that process is part of a mind, in my opinion. 

Why is the room not an embodiment of Mrs Wang's mind, precisely?

> I don't dislike you pointing that out, I agree completely. My point is that ""you're seeing yellow because you appear to be seeing yellow"" isn't an explanation as to how/why subjective experience is generated through objective processes.

So here, again, is my argument. Tell me what step isn't connecting. (Using Korzybski's [...] to indicate ""and so on, in some important sense and to some important degree"")

1) Definition: Computation is the successive transition from state to state of a collection of patterns based on a fixed set of rules.

2) Premise: your thoughts[...] are caused by the processes performed by your neurons[...] in your brain, i.e., the computations your neurons are performing.

3) Definition: you experience[...] a quale if you think you're experiencing a quale.

4) Conclusion: Your experience of a quale is caused by the behavior / computation of the neurons in your brain.

5) Speculation: Any computation performing isomorphic computations will experience isomorphic qualia.

> It's a circular definition. ""Computations which are conscious are computations involved in consciousness"".

That's not what I said.

> You have no way of defining which computations are conscious other than their being involved in computing consciousness. This is not a definition.

It's an excellent definition. It's just not yet objectively testable, because we don't know an effective proof for finding those computations.

> Which is not at all - we can only infer consciousness, we cannnot directly verify its presence in another entity.

That's exactly my point. You criticize me for being unable to use computation to prove the existence of consciousness, yet you'll freely assert that stuff made out of the same kind of matter as you are, behaving in very similar ways, cannot be conscious.

> Untrue - if panpsychism is correct, then all matter is liable to being conscious depending upon its arrangement. 

That's true of my theory too.

> I didn't catch an explanation of consciousness or any panpsychism there I'm afraid, you'll have to clarify.

I'm explaining what ""explanatory power"" is.

> Because you can't objectively measure subjectivity.

And yet you repeatedly assert that you know its cause and that certain patterns of matter that behave conscious aren't. In spite of the fact that you're sitting there assuming I'm conscious without knowing anything about what I'm made out of.

> > Here, let's get specific: how would you go about confirming the presence or absense of subjectivity in me?

> Inference from our similarity. 

And yet when I present you something that's very similar and could (in theory) do everything I'm doing, you assert that it isn't conscious. You are assuming I'm conscious *because* you're seeing my behavior and judging it to be conscious behavior.

> Computationalism must justify which compuations are conscious and why, 

See above. Then explain why Mrs Wang as a pile of carbon atoms is conscious and Mrs Wang as a pile of silicon atoms isn't.

> I'm not sure why this is relevant. I asked why some computations are conscious, and noted that presumably not all are - are you claiming all computations are conscious now?

I have no idea how you went from my statement ""of course not all computations are conscious just like not all computations are Microsoft Word"" to ""are you claiming Word is conscious?""

> The presence of qualia would be calculation, the fact of awareness remains unexplained.

Are you saying calculation can explain qualia, but not the experience of qualia? What's the difference between

1) I think I am seeing yellow

2) I am aware that I am seeing yellow

3) I am experiencing seeing yellow

3) I am seeing yellow

Which of those are not independent? Because I think at this point we're down to some very precise nits.

> That's not an explanation of subjectivity,

See above and tell me what step confuses you.

> There are no identical piles of matter where one is conscious and the other is not.

That's not what I said. I mean, literally. You're leaving words out.

> Unless you mean ""not at all"",

No, I mean the same way you do.

> I understand perfectly what you're saying, 

I disagree. And when you disagree, you don't justify that disagreement. I present a logical argument, and you either say ""I don't believe that's right"" or you tell me the logic doesn't follow without saying (at least, not clearly enough) which step doesn't follow.

As for the credit I give to panpsychism, I'm coming to believe that you believe consciousness cannot be caused. It must therefore be an intrinsic aspect that isn't caused by anything. If that's the case, then of course none of my arguments about how computation causes consciousness will make any sense."	17

philosophy	eddywhere	"Wonderful response, thank you, I am happy to have the terms declarative and non-declarative (procedural) defined for me, that's helpful when thinking about memories. 

It is easy for me to imagine an abstract reality of electromagnetism that is devoid of time, but I'm not sure I would call that ""objective reality."" 

Philosophers, especially since modern physics, would like to do so, because they are specifically searching for that world. But couldn't it also be imagined that what you call ""the objective realm of particles devoid of time"" could possibly instead be a ""subjective reality as experienced by those particles, with its own set of mechanics under which the universe happens to it?"" 

If ""time as humans perceive it"" is a psychological illusion, then couldn't it stand to reason that that the ""objective reality"" you speak of could also have its own set of ""illusions"" that it operates under, or ways in which it categorizes impressions and ""communicates"" across time, ones that we either don't understand, or could never understand?

Since we really don't fully understand consciousness, and we really don't fully understand particles, who's to say that the time-less version of reality is more objective than ours? We want to believe it is objective, because humans are in constant search of ""fundamental objective truth,"" but what if there is no ""objective reality,"" but rather simply tons of different ""subjective realities"" as experienced by humans, deer, trees, rocks, ions, glueballs, flux tubes, etc?

If we discovered that two different ""fundamental particles"" had impressions left upon them in completely different ways, couldn't they both have their own subjective versions of reality?

I know that is very abstract, but let me pull back then. While it may be abstract to imagine particles ""experiencing"" anything, it's not so hard to imagine that birds or trees have a subjective version of reality that they operate under. Trees don't have minds or memories or consciousness, but they are alive. If all living things had what we call ""consciousness,"" this would be easier. But there is this huge spectrum of life between humans and particles, and there are many opportunities within to imagine other ways in which the mechanics of the universe could be experienced by that life."	12

That's why I'm glad to mainly comport with partners of the same sex - that's one thing I don't have to worry about :P	1
philosophy	AyronHalcyon	"But now you're making the critical mistake of declaring that, since it is difficult/impossible to judge the rationality of certain actions (given a lack of knowledge or perspective), that rationality is an illusion outright.

>perhaps the actions reveal the true values of  the actor, and not their stated objectives. In which case there is no  irrationality, just your own confusion about how the actor can  apparently contradict themselves.

While I, as an individual, may not be able to discern the objectives of the actor, that does not mean that the actor lacks an objective. While I, as an individual, cannot see if the actions satisfy the objective (for I do not know the objective), that does not mean that it is unknown if the actions satisfy the objective. This is why I was careful to specify that I, personally, wasn't following those directions, but that *one* was (although even this may be a mistake; I'll elaborate below). For all we know, the actor may be performing these evaluations themselves.

This argument works for the universalist perspective as well; While I may not know the fundamental objectives/imperatives of humanity, that doesn't mean they don't exist, and that the decisions people make can't be evaluated in relation to such.

Just because one does not, or perhaps nobody can, know what is absolutely rational, does not mean that rationality is an illusion. To suggest so is an argument from ignorance.

&#x200B;

>Furthermore, you're assuming your own perfect knowledge in evaluating these scenarios, which also seems unlikely in most cases.

No, I have not assumed such; as much is evident in the way I have worded the second step (although I could've been more clear):

>One observes or reasons all the properties and consequences of the action ***that one can.***

There may be little one can do in terms of observation or reasoning; they will inevitably lack vital information, be subject to substantial bias, and perhaps even lack all the necessary understanding of reason to be able to do such. One can fail to apply the method here due to personal short-comings. This is why it may be best to do this collectively; many can counterbalance each other's weaknesses. Such will, more often than not, yield better results than doing alone. That isn't to ignore the group biases that can emerge in reasoning; they still must be contended with, and failure to do so may result in catastrophe.

While mankind does have an inherent rational nature, that does not mean that rationality should be rejected, for there are strategies one may implement for managing such, be it awareness of ones irrationality or working with others.

Nonetheless, even imperfect practice of reasoning/rationality often enough produces useful results that it is worthwhile to practice, let alone evidence that refutes the idea that it is an illusion; The evidence for that is sprawled throughout the historical record, in its application in mathematics, philosophy, and the sciences, both physical and social. What enables us to talk right now is the praxis of rationalism.

Rationality is pragmatically valid, and when one is trying to achieve anything, one ought to evaluate the methods of doing so in a pragmatic manner.

philosophy	Earnesto101	"Allow me to add some more perspectives on this; to be honest I’m more of a scientist than philosopher so correct me if I’m going astray. 

Memory, and perception of time, are renowned for being philosophically elusive, and I personally think this is due to inadequate definitions.

I think it is perfectly valid to imagine an abstract objective reality which consists only of energy, mass, electromagnetic energy and a few other things, a world without our impressions of sound, colour etc, a world it some sense of ‘raw’ state.
However, I think it’s necessary to admit that this is, and always will be an abstraction. 

Perceptions of this ‘world’ will always be subjective. The psychoanalysts would define the mind as ‘the subjective aspect of the body’. 
I’m real terms, there isn’t ever going to be a fixed and ridged, platonic form of reality. Objectivity is instead a sort of agreement between multiple perceptions about what can, and should be inferred as the ‘truth’. Obviously this line of thinking gets a little messy when you have so much to contend for (cue epistemology), but I don’t know a more rational way that subjectivity can be reasoned with. 

When we talk about memory in humans, there are many distinct forms of memory, which makes things even more difficult to refine. Generally, we have short and long  term memory types. Long term memories can be declarative (facts and events) or non-declarative (procedural things like remembering how to ride a bike).

The interaction of memory and perception of time is when things get really hectic.
When you sit on a bench for half an hour, does it feel like a long time because you have perceived time? Or because you remember all of the instances of the time you were sitting on the bench and they add up to a long time? When I ask you what you ate for breakfast seven days ago, do you know the ‘feeling’ of seven days and subtract that from now, back into that experience? Or do you imagine a calendar, work out what day that was, reference yourself to other things that happened that day and recall the breakfast time that fits in with them.
It’s not easy to distinguish memory and time. 

However, when we look at why memories actually exist, we find that they are literally just connections between neurones in the brain. We form new connections, strengthen some, make some weaker and overall we are left as some impression of our perceived environment. The impressions stay with us sometimes, but they are open to being tampered with in all sorts of psychological ways. I’m simple neural circuits, scientists can even engineer memories by changing the strength of connection between particular neurones. So the memories aren’t ever exact copies of what happened. They are inferences about things that happened, that you have right now. They are not carbon copies of the past.

So when you look at our consciousness, our conscious awareness (however you’d like to describe it) I don’t think there exists anything beyond the current moment. It’s sort of like a space of competing sensory experiences and memory representations.

There’s no time other than our experienced perception of time’s direction. 
Sure we can record it for comparison between experiences (objectivity), but there’s no experiential consistency in the perception of time. It’s more of a psychological illusion if you ask me."	12

philosophy	eddywhere	"I don't think so, I think he is using ""March backwards into the future"" as another analogy for the same concept.

The ""facing backwards"" part doesn't apply to the car analogy, only the ""marching backwards"" analogy. ""Marching backwards"" is a turn of phrase, like ""walking backwards"" and it has a definition. When someone says ""marching backwards"" it means walking one way while facing the other way.

This is similar to driving a car while looking in the rear view mirror. Both analogies represent a human moving one direction but looking the opposite direction.

As far as what he means by those analogies, that's a different story. But the analogies themselves work fine, and are two ways of saying the same thing.

For me, driving a car while only looking in the rear view mirror and walking backwards are both apt analogies for a human who is moving forward in time and space, but ignoring what is ahead of them, instead focusing on the past/present. In order for humans to progress, we must look to the future, because we will march on regardless, and if we only look backwards we may fall off a cliff."	2

>All that could happen in tons of realistically imaginable AI situations in ways that didn't necessarily come with the ability to communicate they'd achieve them

I flatly reject the notion that it could happen in ""tons"" of situations, and I note that you've haven't provided even one example.  It stills seems to me to be the case that it's impossible that the experience of such a profound emotional state could not be accompanied by the ability to conceptualize it, and in turn to communicate it.

>and certainly there's no reason to think they'd necessarily be capable of straightforwardly stating in english that they had if that wasn't designed for successfully.

Certainly, but I'd say that ""straightforwardly stating in English"" isn't a necessary requirement, and I apologize if anything I said implied that.

Anyone who's spent any time around any better-than-marginally intelligent creatures, and who's paid the least attention, has learned to understand a great deal of their communication.  They rather obviously DO communicate their emotional states (among other things), though certainly not ""straightforwardly in English.""  It's still not even particularly difficult to understand them - the only obstacle is the people who simply refuse to acknowledge their rather clear attempts to communicate.  Again, that will likely be a problem with AI, but it's not a problem the essay addressed.

>Beyond that, states outside human conception should be viewed as on the table as well, and for systems that were really different, perhaps they'd reach such thresholds earlier than some of the other's we're talking about. If we get to the point of really making AI, we're talking about the ability to make minds, and there's no reason to assume that the space of minds that nature carved a path into with brains is anything like a straight line without forks, that people just walked the furthest down.

Now this is the part I found fascinating, but I'm not going to comment further on it at the moment, just because it does seem to be fertile ground for further thought and I haven't given it that thought yet.  And because I've already gone on too long and even if you aren't bored, I have other things I should be doing ;)  It is at least the case that the possibility of a ""consciousness"" somehow fundamentally different from our biologically-biased notions of it does establish a parallel possibility of some equally different form of ""suffering,"" though I still tend to suspect that there could be no form of suffering that would be outside of the sort we associate with actual physical pain and the sort we associate with complex emotions, and those are the two categories I already addressed.  The specific mechanisms and such could well be quite different, but it seems that it would necessarily boil down to the same essentials.  But I'm not certain of that, so I'll have to think on it more.

Thanks for the response."	-1
philosophy	BobCrosswise	"(1 of 2)

You raise some interesting points, but I think you overstate the case for a lot of them.

> For one, depending on what you're trying to single out as ""existential suffering"", I wouldn't necessarily agree that pain and existential suffering are the only kind of suffering that exist in animals.

I used the term ""existential suffering"" to denote all forms of ""suffering"" that manifest psychologically - grief, fear and shame would be the most obvious.

I wouldn't insist that all suffering can be divided into those two categories, but I can't think of a third.

>Many things can impact an animal's emotional state without having much bearing on their outlook of the world or themselves.

This seems to take a narrower view of ""existential suffering"" than I intended.  

>And people can suffer greatly due to issues like depression that stem from defects in their biological functions

I don't think a case has actually been made that issues like depression ""stem from defects in... biological functions.""  There's certainly a biological component to them, but I think that the notion that they stem solely from biological ""defects"" is a product of a certain degree of ultimately not-fully-warranted faith in materialism broadly, and pharmacology narrowly.

And considering it, I'm not sure that a case can be made that something like depression, regardless of root cause(s), qualifies as suffering anyway.  Many people live much of their lives in a state that might be diagnosed as depression, and with no particular hardship (and even in some notable number of cases, with no real awareness of it).  It seems to me that at least a considerable amount of the nominal hardship of depression is actually a manifestation of something separate, and one of the things that I'd already count as existential suffering.  It's not that the depression itself is suffering, but that ""depression"" can lead to life choices that will in turn trigger fear or grief or shame or the like.

Now, all that said, it does seem to me that you're potentially onto something here, and I don't intend to dismiss it out of hand.  But I still can't see how it would warrant a third category of ""suffering"" - one that's not already included with either a network of pain receptors that AIs won't possess unless we deliberately equip them with them, or a degree of symbolic consciousness such that any AI that is able to experience it would also be able to communicate that fact.

>Secondly, looking at pain, what makes pain response in people and animals something with ethical weight is the effect upon the mind of a living being, specifically the emotional impact on them (besides what they tend to indicate about our well being). If our tactile senses were felt dispassionately, then pain would not be something different than say, looking at sensor readouts, as an experience.

I disagree with this entirely.  While there's certainly (at least beyond some threshold of consciousness) emotional impacts of pain, pain itself is fundamental.  It is, and necessarily, something that beings suffer from, entirely regardless of emotional impact.

In fact, if anything, I'd say that this is exactly backwards - that to the degree that a being might be capable of an emotional response to pain, it actually diminishes the possibility that it could be counted as suffering, since one might possess some psychological or biochemical condition such that pain is interpreted as pleasure, or at least is something from which one derives some measure of satisfaction.  I sincerely doubt that masochism even exists below a certain threshold of consciousness - without the ability to hang some emotional interpretation on it, pain is nothing but raw and primal suffering.

>If you want to talk about the potential for suffering in something, you're talking about it's emotional state, at least in very large part

I don't think that's true.  Emotional state is obviously a part of the greater whole, at least in some instances, but I think the obvious hierarchy is the other way around - that pain is fundamental and emotional interpretations thereof are secondary.

>and maybe it's 'motivational' state more generally too.

This is the point at which I think you start reaching.  You really haven't provided any support for the inclusion of ""motivational"" states among things that might generate suffering - you've simply drawn close enough to it to make the leap to blandly appending it to the list.  It appears that you've reasoned backwards - that you started with a thing that's of notable interest to AI research, and to the designation of AI (motivation), then assembled an argument that got you somewhere close enough to it that you might colorably claim that it's tied in with suffering.

>It seems like it's much more to do with having an analog to our emotional and/or motivational systems.

And there's ""motivational"" again, now elevated to a position of equivalency with ""emotional.""  So it becomes that much more pertinent that you didn't really make the case for a connection between a ""motivational"" system and suffering.

Now, that's not to say that such a case couldn't be made - in fact, I find it intriguing that, at heart, pain is a motivational system.  That appears to be its primary purpose - to prevent creatures from engaging in actions that cause harm to themselves and to lead them to respond in appropriate ways to existing harm - to not put weight on a broken leg, for instance.  I think there might well be something there, but it's buried more deeply than you imply here, and isn't necessarily as foundational as you make it out to be.

>AI could totally have those things.

Totally?

First, I think you're definitely leaping here - it's really not a likelihood that warrants such an enthusiastically absolute quantifier.  And I'd say that to the degree that it is a likelihood, it would fit in with what I've already addressed as ""existential suffering"" - suffering that's a result of not only experiencing a particular thing, and not even necessarily only of having an ""emotional"" reaction to that thing, but of being conscious of that experience and that reaction - being able to hang a concept on it.  

And as I think about it, that would seem to be just that much more the case if we include emotional responses to ""motivational"" systems.  The most obvious negative emotional response triggered by such systems would be frustration, and we know from countless examples that there's a threshold below which frustration potentially doesn't manifest at all, and certainly doesn't manifest as ""suffering.""  In fact, that's one of the fundamental things upon which we base recognition of consciousness - below a certain threshold, unsatisfied motivations appear to trigger no meaningful response at all - the creature just ""mindlessly"" keeps repeating the action.  It's only above a particular threshold that unsatisfied motivations appear to trigger the actual emotional state that we refer to as ""frustration, "" and its nominal accompanying suffering.

>Maybe emotions are something tied to any kind of motivational system within systems of the right kinds complexity, state modeling, self awareness, whatever.

To some degree, I'd say that they obviously are.  I don't think that's in any way contrary to anything I've already said though.  The exact thing that establishes the threshold such that you assert that they're tied to any kind of motivational system ""within systems of the right kinds complexity, state modeling, self awareness, whatever"" is the ability to conceptualize an emotional state, which seems to inadvertently be accompanied by an ability to communicate that state.  Now it's definitely the case that we often, and particularly with lesser creatures, fail or refuse to note the instances in which they communicate their emotional state, but that's a failure of perception.  

The nominal problem addressed in this essay is an AI that might experience such states and be unable to communicate them.  I just don't think that's possible - if they're sufficiently advanced to experience them, then they're necessarily sufficiently advanced to communicate that experience.

A simple analogue would be the way that people view love.  We have this concept of ""puppy love"" - the love that children might feel for each other.  We tend to treat it as something less than ""real"" love, but that's obviously not because the experience is less significant - anyone who's been through it knows that - and it's not even because children are incapable of communicating it.  It's solely because we refuse to take it seriously.

Now, similarly, there's a possibility (and I'd say near-certainty) that if AI reaches the point at which it can suffer emotionally, some number of people will refuse to take the evidence of that suffering seriously.  And that's undoubtedly a thing about which we should be conscious.  But that's not the point that this essay is addressing - it's addressing the possibility of such suffering existing in an AI that would be incapable of communicating it, and I just don't think that's even possible (save instances of malfunction).

philosophy	eddywhere	"I know it's not always well received to mix quantum physics and philosophy, but I think it's relevant here. And also I will define ""time"" before I begin. I believe the ""time"" you are speaking of is ""time as perceived by humans."" I might first suggest that there could be other versions of ""time,"" or something like it, that other beings or objects experience, but in a different way than humans. Whether or not we would even call this ""time,"" I don't know, but I will be calling it ""time"" for the sake of discussion here.

What you consider a ""memory"" is somewhat subjective. People ""remember"" differently. But let's call memories ""impressions"" instead for a moment. Many philosophers agree that your present self is an amalgamation of all the impressions that have occurred in your past. And, like you said, this gives us a concept of time.

What we consider ""memories"" are difficult to imagine happening to a tree or a rock, but I can imagine that trees and rocks do experience ""impressions.""

Physicists have already observed quantum particles in ""non-living"" things communicating with each other across time. Whether or not these particles ""experience"" time in any way is still unknown. It may be true that the reason quantum particles *can* do this is because they do *not* experience time, and so they do exist in this time-less field.

For me, the more I dive into the concept that consciousness is required to perceive time, the more it falls apart. Human consciousness is required to perceive *the human version* of time, but just because it's not *our version*, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. 

I think deer perceive time. Not the same as us, but they do perceive it. If an animal learns not to do something by experience, then that animal obviously experiences time, or else why wouldn't it have known to not do the thing already in a timeless realm?

Now let's go farther from human consciousness and take a tree. Obviously a tree doesn't perceive time like we do, but we don't know that they exist in a field free of time. Trees have ""impressions"" left on them, and while they clearly don't ""remember memories"" like we do, their atoms might ""communicate"" across time in a way we don't understand. They might even experience time in a ""more complex"" way than we do. So what we label ""free of time"" may actually not be, it is just ""different than the only version of time we are able to perceive.""

Lastly, we can take the most difficult to imagine: rocks. While it is much easier to imagine rocks living in this ""quantum"" state, free of time, we still don't know. Scientists have observed ""impressions"" being left on inanimate objects. While many would argue ""we are just imposing our perception of things on to them,"" I might suggest that we really don't know. The entire universe might communicate with itself through some version of time, it's just not the version of time we perceive as humans. 

So you said that our memories are giving us our concept of time. I believe memories and impressions are the same. So if rocks are having ""impressions"" left on them, how can we say certainly now that they don't experience time in *some way*.

philosophy	Pseudoboss11	"Well, in special relativity, there's a factor known as gamma, or the [Lorentz factor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor). Gamma is strictly greater than 1, and increases to infinity as v->c. For any observer, for example, looking at a clock moving relative to it, that clock will appear to be moving slower by a factor of gamma. If you're curious to know more, look up [time dilation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation). To really drive the relativity of time home, imagine if you have two observers, moving relative to each other, and each riding a clock. Both of them can look at their own clock, and see it ticking normally. If observer A looks at clock B, it will see the clock ticking slow. But if observer B looks at clock A, it will see A's clock ticking slow! This is known as the [twin paradox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox). It's resolved in general relativity, but that's too much math for a post written while on the toilet.

One last thing, I don't have time to explain, but also read about the [relativity of simultaneity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity) just in case you were hoping that any sense could be made with regard to our standard notions of time.

philosophy	Mauss22	"**ABSTRACT:**  

>Science is often held to give us the best insight into the nature of reality, with a prestige unmatched in other disciplines. But what is the scientific method and how does it operate? Does it give us objective knowledge or does it just 'work'? And if an electron is an ""unobservable entity"", why should we believe that they exist? Professor **Stathis Psillos** gives a detailed look at the philosophy of science 

**EXTRACT**:

>Broadly speaking, there are four kinds of questions that philosophy of science deals with: metaphysical, epistemic, conceptual, and practical.  
>  
>On the *metaphysical* front, the key issue is the implications of the scientific image of the world about the basic ontological categories of the natural (and social) world. For instance, are there laws of nature? What does causation consist of? Are there natural kinds and properties? Do things in the world happen by necessity? Do worldly objects possess causal powers? Are there mechanisms that generate or support various functions and behaviours?  
>  
>On the *epistemic* front, the key issue is the epistemic credentials of science and in particular the status of scientific knowledge. Science relies on theories, hypotheses, and principles which typically but not invariably go beyond the observable aspects of the world and describe it as possessing a hidden-to-the-senses causal-explanatory structure. How are these theories supported or licensed by the evidence? How seriously should we take the scientific image of the world as being true or true-like in order to have a just view of science?  
>  
>On the *conceptual* front, the key issue is the ways scientific theories represent the world as well as the conditions of representational success. Science represents the world via theories and theories employ a number of representational media, from language, to models, to diagrams etc. Scientific theories employ, almost invariably, idealisations and abstractions in representing natural phenomena. How do scientific concepts acquire their content? How is it best to understand the conceptual connections between theories? How is it best to evaluate the representational content of theories? How is it best to understand the relation of theories to experience and experiment?  
>  
>On the *practical* front, there are a number of issues having to do with ethical, social, and other practical problems. Science is far from value-free, and the investigation of the place, role and function of values in science has been an important element of our scientific thinking. Values do not function as methods do, yet they are constitutively involved in scientific judgements and in theory-choice and evaluation in science. Feminist approaches to science have played a key role in uncovering various cognitive and social biases and have promoted the image of a socially responsible science. Issues about the ethics of science, the structure of scientific research, risk-analysis, and the role of science (and of the scientists and the scientific institutions) in policy-making have acquired prominence.  
>  
>In practice, all these fronts are intertwined. In my view, a *proper* engagement with philosophy of science should deal with all four kinds of issues and have a historical dimension, too."	27

> Karl Popper, a very influential philosopher, argued that science was distinguished from other forms of knowledge if it made predictions that were falsifiable, for example. On the other end of this debate, was an Austrian, a fellow named Faul Feyerabend, one of the important philosophers of science, and he argued very convincingly that there is no method in this universe for all sciences, that sometimes one method works in one part of science and sometimes it doesn’t work and another method works.

Maybe their job is to put those different pictures together; none of them by themselves seems to have the ring of truth or to go all the way to make a complete theory. We’re not there but we have lots to think about. There are lots of partial solutions. It can be very inspiring and also, it can be very frustrating.

It seems like you might be assuming that because this particular physicist adopts a position you do not hold yourself he must be ignorant of broader developments in the philosophy of science. Please consider this relevant fact: Smolin is actually quite smart. If he has a certain opinion, it might be because he's considered compelling arguments for that position, rather than because he is content to wallow in unsophisticated ignorance, bereft of much-needed guidance from the enlightened philosopher caste. 

Of course, maybe this is wrong. It's possible that you're right and he's just an arrogant blowhard ignorant of the history of philosophy of science. But *defaulting to the assumption* he is an arrogant blowhard on the basis of so little evidence as you did is a horribly ironic approach to take. It's true that some physicists are overconfident jerks, but hastily appealing to the stereotype of physicists in general as overconfident jerks makes you a jerk yourself.

Instead, it slows down in that direction. The spaceship will also observe the earth's time as also moving slower, so it would still be able to compute the speed of the relatistic fastball in the earth's reference frame, and an observer on the earth would be able to do the same for the spaceship.

This definition of ownership conflicted with the desires of the wealthy elites, who began to literally put up fences (enclose) plots of common land with the intent of forcing the peasants who lived upon it to pay ""rent"" to them in addition to the state. The method by which the ""investors"" acquired the land to which they laid claim (putting up a fence and saying it's yours) was illegal both under common/feudal law, and under the new legal system that they created-- which was precisely the point, in order to prevent anyone else from just putting up their own fences."	-2

philosophy	AyronHalcyon	"Well, short-sighted pragmatism would perhaps prescribe such behaviour.

It is practical for me to pollute the environment with a car, but that is only if the *only* end goal I have is to get to where I want to be. However, I don't only want to get to where I want to be. I also:

* Want to have enough money for my family, and
* Maintain the welfare of my community, and...

Pragmatism need not to be applied in a vacuum. If I consider all the things I want to achieve, and weigh every action I take in relation to those things, we can see argue that it isn't pragmatic for me to pollute the environment:

* Maybe if I take public transportation and save on gas and insurance, I will both protect the environment and save money, so I can provide my family additional opportunities.
* Maybe if I stop polluting the environment, and buy an EV, my community will not breathe toxic fumes, which helps with their well-being.

All of these are pragmatic choices, given the goals I want to achieve; Perhaps you'd agree, given this point you've made:

>What's pragmatic for an individual isn't always pragmatic for the group.

I don't take this to be an admonishment of it's practice, but rather an acknowledgement of its limitations. Being a pragmatist does not necessarily mean being an individualistic pragmatist. I'm not certain that being a complete individualistic pragmatist is a good thing (I'm sure it sometimes makes sense to be one, and times where it doesn't). To then say that pragmatism, as a whole, is what allows us to make destructive decisions is to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

If I were to diagnose the current situation, what is happening is that the western population is practicing pragmatism as individuals, while their institutions are failing to be pragmatic in principle.  It should be mostly the other way around, with the goals of the institutions being, without deeply getting into it, altruistic in nature."	4

The planet would continue to see the sun for those minutes, the planet would even _continue to orbit_ around the sun. For us, those entire 8 minutes, the sun continued to exist.

Once a woman is pregnant the man should be at least half as financially responsible for an abortion, if they so choose to get one.

philosophy	n4r9	"> observation does not require a conscious observer

Okay, you're using the word ""observation"" in a slightly unusual way here. The problem is that the meaning and physical significance of the word ""observation"" varies slightly between interpretations. Normally it connotes whatever physical process coincides with a (real or apparent) collapse of the quantum wavefunction.

In Everettian interpretations, the wavefunction is real but the collapse of the wavefunction is apparent. Instead of collapse actually occurring, there's a kind of extension of superposition to the measuring apparatus and eventually to the humans who are conducting the experiment. In this context it kind of makes sense to use the words ""observation"" and ""quantum interaction"" interchangeably.

In Bayesian interpretations like QBism, neither the wavefunction nor its collapse are real physical occurrences. They are part of a rulebook that an agent uses to formulate predictions about their future observations. In this context an observation is literally the outcome of an agent's interaction with Nature. Whilst there is a reality out there that we're all interacting with constantly, it ain't necessarily what's described by quantum theory."	-3

His books are pretty fun (if you can find copies) and there's some videos of his on Youtube.

Basically his big idea was the ""medium is the message"", which later became ""the medium is the massage"".

He was a guy from the 60s who saw the transition from radio to television, and then computers.

He had theories about ""hot"" and ""cool"" media, and how different media affect people.

He made the (at the time) controversial claim that media's biggest effects on people are independent of its content.  (Regardless of what programs people watch on tv, everyone's receiving similar sensory stimulation.)

The quote above is related to his idea that when a new media comes along, at first no one really understands it.  They try to use any new media in ways similar to how they used the older one (in the ways they are used to), so it's more that the new media has to change them.And it's usually only over time they really understand the true nature of the new media and how it has changed them.

philosophy	TheGerild	"Descartes, Hume, Sceptics of the Hellenistic Age, Heidegger, Nietzsche.

From our subjective experience we cannot infer the existence of anything, but that subjective experience itself, thus there is no proof that anything objective really exists.

Objective reality is then assumed (in form of some true world theory, see Nietzsche) to argue points about objective morality, ethics or science.

It is (seemingly) VERY useful to assume some form of objective reality even though it cannot be proven.

And if it's quantum physics you are interested in there is a whole series from MIT on Youtube, which is just captured lectures, very informative.

But I disagree that quantum physics has anything to do with the metaphysics of objective reality. It is really just substituting the true world theory of a static objective world with that of a stochastic one."	7

You need to show society that you, yourself are willing to sacrifice everything you've been taught. The beginning stages of life we mimic the people around us. This is the bottom of our pyramid. We evolve and grow. Everybody has a foundation. As a whole we have an expectation of what the world expects of us. That is the knowledge given. We need to use that knowledge in a practical rational way, as a small group. Its pointless to impose this on the population. Like a virus we need to infect the ones around us.

Given that the brain is being directly manipulated to achieve a desired outcome (permanent happiness), it's conceivable that *any* desired outcome could be engineered.

They could be engineered to take note of their failures, and still learn from them, but without becoming discouraged.

But that creates another problem: should *everyone* be engineered to be creative? If not, how is it decided which behaviour to give to which individuals? What happens to our free will (if it exists to begin with)? Would we ever want anything that were not specifically engineered to want? Would we be engineered with a certain level of randomness to maintain our individuality, or is individuality even important? So many questions."	7

That reference to it is only a reference to someone’s perception of it, since nobody can understand it fully from every angle, and when we reference it we can only utilize it from the extent of what we have?

I have no clue how that works outside of perception.  In a world with no consciousness, what does ""previous"" even mean?   What does ""objective"" even mean?  There wouldn't even be objects without a subject to perceive them.

No two humans will ever experience the exact same thing, even if they are staring at the same thing when it occurs.  Based on our intuition, you would think time passes on in the background like it always does.

Time is entirely objective. Perception of time is however highly subjective. For instance it has been shown that young kids experience twice as much time as very old people because of how much faster their brains function. Similar effects come into play most likely with great hitters. However, this doesn't change the objective amount of time that has passed.

Time is also relative, such as how greater gravity slows the relative passage of time, but this doesn't change its objective nature. The difference in what is perceived (assuming two objective observers) is because of relativity, not subjectivity. Subjectivity is a difference in perception, relativity is a difference in physics, which is objective."	7

Further what if in this state the idea of ""knowing"" the past was as absurd as the possibility of ""knowing"" the future currently. We can make estimates based on the available evidence, much like we currently can when predicting the future, but no more than this. Really it began as Free-will thought experiment.

In the other we only know what has already happened with events further away a vaguer and vaguer memory.

philosophy	mythoughtsforapenny	"I think saying the value of π is unknowable is similar to saying the value of three is unknowable. Three is just three. That's is the simplest way that we can state its value, but it is a tautology. It really just tells us that the name of the concept is ""three"". We can also write ""three"" in different, unnecessarily complicated, ways. We can say 3 = 6/2. But we can also say π = τ/2. Also, for both three and π, we can determine exactly how they compare to any rational number, and we can determine exactly how they compare to an infinite number of irrational numbers (but there are some irrational numbers that we can't compare to 3 or to π, or determine where they belong on the number line). If the rational number we're comparing to three and to π is a fraction of two very large numbers, it might take a while to determine for sure whether it's greater than or less than (or in the case of three, equal to) three or π, but we can always make the comparison in a finite amount of time. Both three and π have a precise place on the number line, and we can always say where each of them lies on the number line relative to anything else that we've called a number so far (whole numbers, rational numbers, irrational numbers that are like √(2), and transcendental numbers that are like π).

So irrational numbers aren't particularly different from rational numbers in terms of our ability to know their value. What makes them different is that, for certain ways of writing the value of a number, it will take forever to write an irrational number, even though it would take a finite amount of time to write any rational number. There are ways of writing numbers that take infinite time for some rational numbers. It would take you forever to write the precise value of 1/11 as a decimal number, since you'd have to keep repeating ""09"" over an over again and you'd never have a perfectly accurate representation of the value of 1/11. There are also ways to write the value of π so that it only takes a finite amount of time. π = 2*arcsin(1). There are other numbers that do not have the property that we can always determine, in a finite amount of time, how they compare to other numbers. They are called non-computable numbers."	8

philosophy	Day_Jah_Voo	"This seems kind of problematic to me along a few lines. 

For one, depending on what you're trying to single out as ""existential suffering"", I wouldn't necessarily agree that pain and existential suffering are the only kind of suffering that exist in animals. Many things can impact an animal's emotional state without having much bearing on their outlook of the world or themselves. And people can suffer greatly due to issues like depression that stem from defects in their biological functions, rather than anything to do with their environment or beliefs at all. 

Secondly, looking at pain, what makes pain response in people and animals something with ethical weight is the effect upon the mind of a living being, specifically the emotional impact on them (besides what they tend to indicate about our well being). If our tactile senses were felt dispassionately, then pain would not be something different than say, looking at sensor readouts, as an experience.

And that's the main point I think I'd disagree about. If you want to talk about the potential for suffering in something, you're talking about it's emotional state, at least in very large part and maybe it's 'motivational' state more generally too. In something mirroring animals in design, that has nothing to do with having an analog to the tactile sense system. That's just a pressure/heat measurement system basically. 

It seems like it's much more to do with having an analog to our emotional and/or motivational systems. AI could totally have those things. And especially if they were designed to do things besides mirror animals, they could easily come to have similar things in very different ways. Who says the amygdela-in-a-brain system's some platonic example of a thing that make's it's mind scared, or the parietal lobe to pain. Maybe emotions are something tied to any kind of motivational system within systems of the right kinds complexity, state modeling, self awareness, whatever. All that could happen in tons of realistically imaginable AI situations in ways that didn't necessarily come with the ability to communicate they'd achieve them, and certainly there's no reason to think they'd necessarily be capable of straightforwardly stating in english that they had if that wasn't designed for successfully. 

Beyond that, states outside human conception should be viewed as on the table as well, and for systems that were really different, perhaps they'd reach such thresholds earlier than some of the other's we're talking about. If we get to the point of really making AI, we're talking about the ability to make minds, and there's no reason to assume that the space of minds that nature carved a path into with brains is anything like a straight line without forks, that people just walked the furthest down. It just seems sort of backwards to say ""we know certain kinds of suffering are available to animals/people, but as long as AI isn't designed to be super similar to us, they won't suffer"". Who knows what features of our brains are that are giving rise to those things in us, or what other kinds of systems might or might not feel and experience. It can be hard enough for us to say as much as we'd like about that as far as other animals and people goes!"	7

Animals including humans balance a large number of conflicting desires of varying complexity, such as drinking to survive or feeling accepted.

philosophy	JLotts	"I pushed everyone away too. Looking back, I realize it was a matter of neglect. I was always looking away from my surroundings, and the people in my life. I was more concerned with video games than life. The world was like an infinite shelf of toys, most of which I did not care to play with. And so my surrounding world became dusty and forgettable. I cared more about getting approval from others than I cared about their lives. I hid behind a fickle compassion that would flare up when guilty, and then dissipate nearly as fast as it flared up, as I returned to my bubble of reality.

So I never really learned to be social. I became embarrassed of how awkward I was, so I started refusing social invitations. My memory started getting worse,--for how can things be remembered if they aren't given any attention? At the age of 30 now, a decade after I started pushing everyone away, I am single with no kids, and only one friend I stay in touch with mostly through video games. Memory problems make relationships even more difficult, since people feel ignored and bothered when they have repeat themselves all the time. The good news is that it is actually possible to grow one's caringness towards others and the surrounding world, as well as memory faculties about them. This accomplished by willing an overall change of attention. The bad news is that it takes a great deal of time and effort. Instead of letting attention drift aimlessly as desire wills, or otherwise traveling excessively about what has been lost or what could be lost, attention could be pushed to circle around all that is had and cared about. 'Caring' is a muscular exercise that can be strengthened and made more agile.

I know you said you were hesitant about whether you really care at all. My point is that attention itself is an act of caring, and that perhaps you can find insights by noticing the common content of your attention."	-2

philosophy	cloake	I would say reason can be flawed in it of itself when we are presented with an unreasonable problem, like the uncaused cause (moreso the defiance of linear 4D), the unreasonable properties of cognition and the universe, or extrauniversal phenomena. If we limited our definiton to human reasoning, then deep learning reasoning defies our reasoning sometimes. And last I can think of, we can fall into the trap of assuming something is reasonable but the assumption is unreasonable. But since the extraordinarily vast majority of pursuits are not those issues, they are largely irrelevant.	0

It frames the problem in a very sensationalist way , as if Reason is somehow itself flawed. There is no such thing, as too much reason. Only bad logic, and bad reasons. There is no ""Dark Side"" to Reason, it's simply called superstitious, self absorbed, biased nonsense. Rationality is not something you can force - it's a process, like science, where knowledge constantly expands and broadens and gets illuminated by better data, more rigor, etc. What would the data say about ethics, for instance, if we could poll every consciousness? What kind of world is the best of all worlds? What kind is the worst? These questions have answers. Some of which we can even discover right now, a priori.

If the article is trying to say ""Bad reasons exist, and people can be totally delusional in the certainty of their own faculties of reason"", then I'm 100% on board. But if the tone treads into ""Reason can be bad"" ""There's such a thing as too much reason"", then we've entered religious nonsense land - and for good reason, since reason itself is the ultimate destroyer of religious nonsense. It is in the best interests of religious nonsense, as a ""thing"" which wishes to survive, to defend itself against threats."	9

And for that, the Jacobins cut her head off. So the response to her perfect rationality was extreme, murderous *irrationality*.”

These types of hybrid systems have been used at times to great effect in nations -- up until someone eventually breaks it. But even when broken, it can still continue to reap the benefits of earlier successes but then the broken pieces could ""get the credit"". An example of this is how today people don't often talk about Keynesian economics, even though you can pinpoint that in much of Western economic success.

The perfect systems are finely-tuned and have proper controls and balances in place. The perfect system must rely on incentivizing the right behavior, and decentivizing the wrong behavior. 

A good way of summing this philosophy up is saying: ""If honor was profitable, everyone would be honorable.""

Is it a viable criticism to say that trying state socialism to transition into communism is a bad idea? Absolutely. However, that’s not the only idea Marxism has to offer. 

By the same token, I can easily argue that allowing businesses and property to stay in private hands has caused incredible suffering, corruption, and death as well. So while we can lay blame at the feet of *improper* use of Marxist thought, I’d argue that capitalism *by its very nature* is corrupt and incentivizes putting private profit over human life."	-8

philosophy	asshat_trashbag	The key is how we decide which behaviors are unacceptable, because law is not drafted by a blindfolded Justice but by individuals. Why, for example, is loitering considered unacceptable? The act of existing in a space is hardly aggressive. One might argue that existing specifically on private land is contemptuous of the property owner's rights to said land, but then we must wonder how this particular definition of land ownership came to be. Following the threads of Western capitalist law in the Anglo-American tradition, we arrive back at the enclosure period, when the idea that a person could commit a crime simply by existing on a plot of land was first codified in the law. Who was it that made this decision? The simple answer is that this conception of the relationship between private land and an individual was devised by wealthy landowners seeking to stamp out resistance to their violent appropriation of formerly common land on the part of the disenfranchised peasantry. I'm unfortunately a bit too tired to address your point with the level of detail that I'd like to, as what I have supplied may seem a tad anecdotal, but I have access to the papers and primary sources from my criminology courses in undergrad, if you would like to read a more in-depth analysis of the question of neutrality in criminal law.	-6

Universal law, as it applies to articles of governance and criminality, has a history of being used in a less than impartial manner. The first universal criminal law (note that when I say this, it is specifically in reference to English legal tradition in the feudal period, which had a different conception of the mandate of codified law), the Black Act, was drafted and premised on protecting the interests of the wealthy landowners who were attempting to consolidate social control during the enclosures. The Black Act stated that any person caught hunting on newly privatised lands, was to be put to death. While that statement is superficially neutral, it was drafted specifically to stamp out any resistance to the sudden seizing of formerly common land amongst the peasantry. The blindfold over the eyes of Justice was an tied only after those in power had succeeded in stealing that which they desired. My first criminology professor characterized the behavior of those in power during this transitional period from feudal to capitalist law as being similar to the kid who shouts ""time out"" every time they are about to be caught in tag-- the law only becomes universal, thus encoding the legality of the current distribution of property and power, after an ethically questionable large-scale appropriation of common property and power; setting this particular moment as the ""status quo"" undeniably benefited those who had just succeeded in upending it. My basic point, because I've prattled on long enough, is that there is a difference between superficial equality and substantive equity, and that contemporary legal tradition does not necessarily do us a favor by obscuring real differences in personal and societal circumstances under the blanket of universality."	3

Well if there's one surefire way to prevent any chance of progress it's to abandon reason. They haven't even explained how a reduction in reason could solve these problems. Pinker isn't suggesting we're perfectly reasonable, quite the contrary. It's our inadequacy that has seen us unable to solve these problems. More rationality allows us to see that we need to band together to solve problems, even if it doesn't seem prudent to the individual.	8

Irrational in no way means that the reasoning is a mistake or based on “simpler needs”; in fact, one can make extremely rational decisions based on “simpler needs” and end up living a very violent, selfish life by taking whatever you can get away with because, rationally speaking, you believe that you can evade the consequences. Animals behave perfectly rationality based on their immediate needs; being rational doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re basing your decisions on long-term plans over short term need and instincts.

Irrational just means that the thought is not based on justifiable, explainable reasoning and makes no judgement as to whether it’s right or wrong. What he’s trying to assert is that humans are potentially unique in that they can be driven by irrational motives; that not giving space for that in the understanding of human behavior is causing those who do feel those irrational drives most strongly to lash out; that creating policy and having discussion in a way that suppresses and ignores human’s irrational drives means that you’re always going to be left with “irrational” opposition because neither end of that rational/irrational spectrum can fully encompass human experience in a way that makes everyone feel like they’re a real part of the whole."	-10

He is quite explicit, there are **no moral exceptions**. Kant scholars are identical to Biblical scholars in that regard. We have better ways to handle ethical questions in 2019, thankfully.	2
philosophy	Kofilin	"What a load of drivel. Rationality is not a value. The bit about the rights of man is the most telling example of a glaring hole in this argument: giving rights to women or anyone else isn't rational or irrational, it's a choice of values.

Rationality is a property of the behavior of a single individual. Behaving rationally means doing so in a way which is coherent which one's goals and knowledge of the world. Irrational behavior means acting against one's own goals, usually due to simpler needs, confusion or mistakes of reasoning."	-2
philosophy	DadTheMaskedTerror	"What you are describing is not irrationality.  What you are describing is not even necessarily miscalculation.  Suppose someone offers you and a demented person the opportunity to bet $100 on at less than even odds on the flip of a fair coin.  Bet $100 for the opportunity to win $1.  So if you win the flip you win $1, if you lose the flip you lose $100.  You refuse the bet.  The demented person takes the bet and wins the coin flip.  Your refusal could’ve been rational even though you would’ve won if you could’ve seen the future.  The demented person could’ve been irrational even though the bet was won.

Imperfect information does not create irrationality and rationality does not rely on perfect knowledge of the universe."	25

Some reduction strategies are naturally more constructive than others, but we tend to understand that in hindsight. Perhaps the most irrational thing is assuming anyone (especially any one person) has the cognitive capacity to effectively strategize regarding certain macro-level problems. Collective effort has pushed civilization forward, but that develops in the same way any scientific understanding does.	2

It is true that game theory has shown that defecting is the equilibrium for the populations studied. But that doesn't mean this couldn't completely change in 100 years.

philosophy	Mondrow	"I haven't read it yet, but wouldn't ""general equality"" begin to harm the lower earning percentiles?

In my view, equality is a good baseline, but at some point the idea of equity such that people have (as close to as is reasonable) more equal outcomes should also factor in."	4

For example, affirmative action is perceived as ""special favors"" by some people. But the purposes of those actions are to balance out already existing inequality. I would say the wealthy are already given intrinsic ""special favors,"" and these affirmative actions are meant to correct those inequalities.

Of course it would be best to simply remove all favors, but the ""favors"" are systemic at this point, so they may be unremovable. So if a faction of society is already favored with deep-rooted systems that can't simply be removed, the only way to balance this out is to give the other populations ""favors"" as well until it is balanced.

At that point, society would perceive that newfound balance as equilibrium, so it would no longer feel like special favors. Thus it may be necessary to give people special favors in order to eradicate special favors."	11

The problems he identifies are the result of conflating ends (or values) with rationality. The desires are not rational by their nature. Reason is the tool that allows us to satisfy those desires. The people who criticize ""rationality"" on these terms are always just criticizing peoples values, e.g. when communists say they want to rationalize society, what they mean is impose a value system on everyone. Nietzsche's contribution was to recognize this conflation and call on people to reject this kind top-down regime of value."	-5

I know your viewpoint is coming from the left, but if you ever get a chance to read “Politics by Principle, Not Interest"" by James Buchanan, I highly suggest it. He argues that, no matter what decision we make in terms of regulation or deregulation, we need to apply the principle of generality equally. In other words, if we have a rule, it needs to be a stubborn one. It needs to apply to everyone equally. No more special favors and exceptions. It's good stuff. Maybe it's common sense, but it's definitely a good read.

**Clarification**: a lot of people are making the very valid point that equity, not equality, is more important to human welfare.

To list a few examples, 9/11, 2008, trump, brexit, sanders, Bolsonaro, climate change, income inequality, Piketty, rise in leaderless resistance (shootings, mostly white nationalist), politicians who are establishment have a difficult time winning, in the US trust of institutions and other people are at an all time low, China is more successful with right wing authoritarianism, it goes on and on.

philosophy	tallenlo	"Humans have the capacity for rationality, but that capacity doesn't guarantee that we are in fact rational. We are certainly not rational at all times, maybe even not most of the time.

I think reason and rationality have developed as an overlay to a precursor capacity for instinct.  Instinctive behaviors allow an organism to react to its environment without having to spend time making a decision about the best response to make. Evolving in a stable environment, natural selection can result in  beneficial behaviors being pre-programmed. 

The ability to rationally evaluate the environment to find the best response can make the human much more flexible in the face of a rapidly changing environment. Of course, having NO instinctive behaviors available would put an inexperienced humans at great disadvantage  while it is developing the ability to reason. I think evolution has resulted in a work-around.

An an important chunk of our behavior seems to be established before we are 5 years old, when we are just beginning to reason and some even earlier, when we just beginning to use words.  I think a lot of our behaviors that might be called instinctive are established during that per-verbal, pre-rational stage. It's as if the brain had an open channel for the Voice-of-Authority, the voice of our parents.  They tell us stuff and we automatically believe it. We are barely able to speak and certainly not able to reason, but the core beliefs are set and stored in a non-rational part of the brain, a part dealing with emotions instead of ideas. These beliefs, taken automatically as true, form the basis of what would be instinctive behaviors in other organisms. Our parents teach us survivals skills that are evoked without the need to reason out a response. They are like instinctive behaviors that can be tailored to the immediate and current environment.

Since they reside in a non-rational part of the brain, they respond slowly to rational arguments questioning their truth. Eventually our developing rational abilities gather enough authority on their own to undermine these initial beliefs and replace them.

But that undermining and replacing is hit and miss. We can have an emotional belief of one fact, and an intellectual belief of the opposite and they may stay at war for a long time. Declaring ourselves rational does not quiet that contradictory voice."	16

One might argue the Soviet dictator is acting out of a sense of justice through defending the will of the proletariat or some such blather. My point is, ""justice"" as we understand it is not the definitive characteristic of punishment, punishment is simply the imposition of a cost due to some transgression - conflating punishment with our understanding of justice robs us of our ability to critically evaluate our punitive practices.

>What makes you so sure that ""imposing a collective will upon a transgressive individual by coercive force"" is an unjust action?

It was a speculative example, I wasn't claiming this to be the case. What I was trying to get across is that assuming punishments are always just and unjust activities are ""not really punishment"" means that we are liable to assume that our current practices are just simply because we call them punishments.

>There are two separate questions here: the existence of objective justice itself and any particular criteria we may use to apply this concept. The criteria can be completely misguided and I don't think the historical aspect is in way relevant here. Obviously there can be an objectively just way (set of criteria) to punish criminals without it ever actually have been applied perfectly at any point in history.

My point was that if there has been any just punishment in history there will be some invariant feature of all such punishments which would constitute a just form of punishment. This is why I tied history into the notion of objective justness - if there has been any historically just punishments, they will share some common feature. If not, then you will have to elaborate a theory of justice without recourse to historical example and explain why we, of the privileged present, have discovered this universal justness when all before us failed to do so. (Not saying this isn't the case, my point is more that we have no reason to assume that our present actions are just, particularly given the potentially prolific presence of injustice historically.)

> Your main point seems to be that unless we have a clear set of criteria to differentiate just punishment from any other kind of punishment, then they are all the same and simply culturally conditioned forms of behaviour.

That's not at all what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that if you resort to calling only just punishments ""true"" punishments and relegate all unjust punishments to the status of ""some weird social and cultural activities of the Other"" then you risk collapsing our notion of justice into our current punitive practices. To claim that only just punishments deserve the title of punishment is liable to the error of assuming that what we do is just (because why else would we do it?), that all our punishments are punishments (tautologically, by definition) and thus just. This denies the possibility of moral progress, for if we punish and punishment is just, then we cannot possibly be punishing unjustly. Essentially, I think it is more useful to distinguish just and unjust punishments than to only call punishment what we evaluate as just and declare all else to be some *other* activity, particularly since punishment is simply by definition ""the infliction or imposition of a penalty as retribution for an offence."" Whether the punishment and offence are just or not is a matter of evaluation but this does not determine whether or not the activity in question is a punishment or something else - all punishments are costs imposed as a result of some transgression, not simply those which are done under the aegis of justice.

philosophy	mythoughtsforapenny	"I don't think the connection being made is that the Pythagoreans were being overly committed to the value of rationality in their strong belief that all numbers can be expressed as a fraction (i.e. that all numbers are ""rational numbers""). I think Smith is saying that the Pythagoreans' strong belief that everything in the universe could be explained mathematically was an example of being overly committed to rationality. In their view, a number that couldn't be written as a faction would mean that not everything in the universe was perfectly ordered and rational - and that would be a catastrophe.

It's hard to put ourselves in their position because we disagree with every part of that belief. We know that there are irrational numbers. We don't think the existence of irrational numbers implies that the universe isn't ordered. We don't think the universe is ordered (in addition to disagreeing with the reasoning of irrational numbers -> disordered universe). And we don't think that it's big deal that the universe is disordered. We disagree with them about all of these beliefs, and would even characterize them as ""irrational"" (in the epistemological/cognitive sense).

But none of these incorrect beliefs are Smith's focus in telling this (possibly inaccurate or exaggerated) historical narrative. The ""explosion of irrationality"" is that they murdered a guy for proving that the square root of two can't be written as a fraction. That is exceptionally ignorant. What Smith finds interesting about this story is that it was group so dedicated to rationality as a core foundational value that responded in such an ignorant way to new information that challenged their previous ideas."	8

philosophy	AyronHalcyon	"Consider this statement by Smith:

>The desire to impose rationality, to make people or society more  rational, mutates ... into spectacular outbursts of irrationality.

The argument against pursuing rationality seems to be that it results in dangerous irrationality. But, if we consider the historical record, we can see that the pursuit of anything can lead to dangerous irrationality (e.g.: the Crusades, National Socialism). Does that mean that we should stop pursuing anything, or that rationality is a myth?

In each example Smith gives of rationality exploding into irrationality, what occurs can be explained as the followers of the ""rational perspectives"" taking an orthodox, dogmatic stance on their conclusions, and reacting to those who oppose or add to such views with violence. These are irrational approaches to values and beliefs, backed up with irrational action. It isn't that rationality failed, *it is that people failed to manifest rationality.* Is that the fault of rationality, or is that the fault human beings?

Now, we can argue this:

* People have an inherent irrational nature, therefore
* We will always fail to be perfectly rational, therefore
* Systems which depend on people being rational will fail.

But couldn't we then say that a good, rational system is a system that accounts for such irrationality? Our failure to account for our own irrationality is perhaps irrational. Again, It's that we fail to manifest rationality, not that rationality is wrong.

It seems to me that Smith's issue is with dogmatic pursuit of values, rather than rationality itself, and that he pinning it on rationality rather than the actual issue. Perhaps it's the irony of irrational action done in the name of rationality that makes it notable in these instances.

Arguing that the socialist revolution hasn't occurred in the hundred odd years since his death is hardly a refutation of historical materialism.

philosophy	GearheadNation	"I think we are understanding economics differently.  This is not an appeal to authority, but just my background.  When I was taught economics, the professors all agreed that at the foundational level economics was the study of the intersection between infinite need and finite supply.  So the fundamental economic fact for man and mollusk is this:  expend more energy than you take in and you die. So all economics is the attempt to assure a net positive energy inflow both now and in the future.

This is this base.  The human construct of economics is like the human construct of math and physics.  That is, an ever developing approximation aimed at helping us operate in and understand an objective reality.

It follows that to successfully design an economic system we have to have a problem statement that is framed in terms of the reality.  A proper economic “problem” would be something like “every person has 2000 kcalories a day available to them on net, flexible by +\- depending on their individual needs”.  Economics can then go figuring out how to generate 14x10^12 kcalories per day, the distribution chain, etc.

“Every person needs enough food everyday that they are satisfied with their place in society” does have an economic component, but is fundamentally a psychological or, if you like, a sociological problem.  And do we not see this reality in our age where there is less absolute material deprivation than any time in our history but more anger, fury, and division than at any time since the civil war?"	9

Thats very black and white.  Sure, we could say that the free market could be argued as authoritarian, that is a major problem with capitlism.  But that is why we set up the government to not be free market, although buisness does mingle with the government, so does the individuals, the people.  As for morality of it all, I try to keep morals out of logic, as you can morally justify and rationalize almost any action, currently the radical Islamist do that, Isis.  School shooters do this, hell there have been quite a few people who have come to the conclusion that the only moral acceptable action is to eliminate all life since life is suffering.

I do not want a society-as-machine, I'm looking for a world without a state and without class. Without race and without gender.

I particularly enjoyed the arguement you made.  The main problem I have with it, is the whole point of classification.  Humans do this as a way to think, and group people/things/ideas together, for organization.  Its primarily done because humans cannot know all things, and all people are classifiable down to the individual.  To get to a world with out class/state/gender/race, you wpuld have to know all information, or as the Nazis did, eliminate all but 1 set of information...  The alternative is to upload all our brains to computers, than we can know all knowledge in time, and thus achieve your perfect society.

This is as dismissive of the positive effects of Capitalism as the essay is of Marxism, and just as silly too. People adopt Capitalism because its the strongest ideology given our *current* energy+data processing abilities. (Data processing here is a stand in for communication. Effectively a lot of societies advancements can be seen through how well we can make up for the incredible inefficiency of our brain compared to the complexity of a society over Dunbar's limit. Every advancement in storing, processing and communicating data, from the writing, to computers, has increased the complexity of society, and allowed for more human specialization.)

But long and short, Capitalism produces a lot of needed things for specialized actors and it circumvents the lag/data-loss in current human networks by making decision making as autonomous as possible based off broad heuristics of needs, rather than individual requests (Which cut down a lot on data requirements). It has failure points, a lot of them..Tragedy of the commons, public goods, monopolies---where it becomes clear there are still communication failures. In many of these situations, betrayal due to lack of data becomes a potential strategy which forces specific actions. So Capitalism still has a lot of data issues itself. But its the most efficient system for producing genuine quality of life improvements right now. It doesn't mean it will always be, nor does it mean it has zero side effects (I tend to subscribe to the main failure of Marxism being that human networks, due to potential betrayal and self interest strategies and the still enormous data loss across them, can not handle proper distribution yet among larger networks. Human networks do not scale linearly, and Marxism suffers a great deal from scale--but we need scale to produce a lot of the quality of life improvements we have.) 

Any case, its just silly to say ""its nothing"", as if people act purely out of faith. You're confusing abstraction myths (Money being representative of energy input, and abstracted out to be universally useful) with it not existing. And I hate to tell you this, but all of society is based on those same myths at some level. Even your conscious mind is little more than a myth maker to prompt the underlying machinery of your brain to network new actions--probably developed from the simulation on movement our[ brains tend to run as we move through the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s0CpRfyYp8)."	-11

Yes because the motives are different. You asked me to justify this claim which is easy to do. Consider the punishment of a murderer by people who have no personal stake in the case. The motive is in most cases to enforce justice. To make sure that justice is served. The action comes from the intuition that something morally reprehensible has been done and the need for justice arises from this intuition. Now consider a ""punishment"" carried out by an oppressive regime such as Soviet Union where you get thrown in jail (or worse) for criticizing the government. That's not punishment by any sense of the term, it's simply misuse of power no matter how much it might be called deserved punishment in propaganda. This is the reason I make a clear difference between these two. The motives behind these actions are completely different.

&#x200B;

> If there is some objective sense of justice it may turn out that  punishment plays no part in it, that punishment is simply a social  regulatory mechanism which imposes a collective will upon a  transgressive individual through coercive force which in and of itself  is an unjust action; other avenues of dealing with anti-social behaviour  may turn out to be more objectively just than punishment. 

It may turn out that way or it may not. What makes you so sure that ""imposing a collective will upon a transgressive individual by coercive force"" is an unjust action? I suppose there could be other more just avenues of dealing with criminals but whatever they may be, I doubt they could have the deterrent effect of punishment. This is a pretty important factor to take into consideration and any avenue of dealing with criminal behaviour should have the effect of reducing crime. Otherwise it's hard to see how it could be more just than punishment when taken as a whole.

&#x200B;

>You need to point to some objective feature of justness and the  punishments it enacts versus those which are unjust and make it one  which is historically stable

There are two separate questions here: the existence of objective justice itself and any particular criteria we may use to apply this concept. The criteria can be completely misguided and I don't think the historical aspect is in way relevant here. Obviously there can be an objectively just way (set of criteria) to punish criminals without it ever actually have been applied perfectly at any point in history.

&#x200B;

Your main point seems to be that unless we have a clear set of criteria to differentiate just punishment from any other kind of punishment, then they are all the same and simply culturally conditioned forms of behaviour. But if objective justice exists, then some forms of punishment are closer to that concept than others even if we have no clear way to draw the line. In many cases we can draw the line, however, and looking at the motive behind punishment is one way to do that like I said in my opening paragraph."	-5

Justin E.H. Smith

The clearest instance in the book, which I set up as a sort of foundational myth, is the Pythagorean cult in the fifth century BC, which becomes so devoted to the perfect rationality of mathematics that it has trouble dealing with the discovery of the existence of irrational numbers. And so when one of its own, Hippasus of Metapontum, starts telling people outside the group that the world can’t be explained by mathematics alone, legend has it that the leader of the group had him drowned in a fit of anger.”

Game theory also shows that rationality leads to irrational conclusions, where defecting is always the “best” move but not in sum total the best move for both players. Cooperation often leads to better results but if your partner cooperates you should still defect although this means the partner gets more time as you get off free. 

We can define rationality in multiple ways as I believe theres more ways than one of being rational. Deontology is one way, consequentialism is one way and these can mix and mingle and i think this can take us to some wild places. 

What gives YOU or ME the power to determine what is a rational thought? This is also a delimma. Interesting read and I agree.

This is true, but the counter is ""what if everyone does it""? If *everyone* chose not to work, then there would be no access to anything at all. There would be nobody to produce the food and administer the healthcare.

That's why socialism isn't just about ""to each their needs"", it is also necessarily about **""from each their abilities""**; it is about the binding moral duty to care for those in need. Anarcho-bohemians like /u/Bunerd up there resent the idea of being morally bound to anything, and so they find this fact inconvenient and don't ever want to tell it straight to people."	5
philosophy	Zeal514	"Edit clarifying my first paragraph, Maybe you agree with me on this, not maybe I believe this.

Hmm we may be arguing past one another.  I think we agree that societies are fundamentally change the individual, and maybe that the individual fundamentally changes society (maybe).  I believe its primarily the individual first.  This means that you hold the individual accountable for the individuals actions, not the society accountable for the individuals actions.  IE its not all black peoples fault that the individual black guy decided to be a criminal.  While black society may play a role, the answer isnt to condemn the society, but to build up the individuals within the society to make the society better.  Another way to say it would be, there are 10 people in a house with 10 bedrooms and a common area, and they all are messy, so the place is an unbearable pigsty.  We dont condemn the society of the house for it, we condemn the individuals, because it requires the individuals to clean there own rooms, and if all individuals focused on bettering themselves, society would inturn be better.  

This is essentially the fundamental principle in any Anonymous program, for addiction, like AA or NA, or adult child of alchohalics(ACA), etc.  An addict lives by the idea that its everyone and everything fault they use or have problems, ""its your fault I drink, you are so damn crazy you drive me to drink!...(because I cannot take your shit)"".  This justifies drinking, and short of attacking the people (or the highschool, like in school shooters mentality).  While you may be able to come up with your own justifications for your actions, it doesnt make it the best action, after all even the Nazis justified there actions in their minds.  The better way to be would be to find out how the individual is wrong, so instead of attack the crazy person driving you to drink, its better for you to find ways to deal with the crazy person, and thats hard because that means you have to change yourself.  This is even harder for ACA, because its truly not their fault, they are truly the victims of the people in AA.  But that doesnt change the idea that they still have to better themselves on an individual level.  Often times this is confused with victim blaming.  But if you are an ACA, the one constant thing in your life is you, so you better fix your problems, even if they werent initially caused by you, because your the primary person who will suffer from them."	-6

There is a good critique of this in saying that providing for everyone's basic material needs would prevent people rising up against an unjust government.

philosophy	kimya_d	"> Consciousness is the immediate fact of my experiencing anything at all

The use of “my” and “experience” presuppose consciousness. I agree with the statement but, being circular, it doesn’t tell us anything about when or how often it occurs.

The only reason to think that consciousness exists at all is because I observe it. I observe it only in rare moments of introspection. In those moments, the observer, the observed and the process of observation are all one recursive whorl that manifests as a feeling. That is the “I” that I know exists—the awareness that at that moment some process is perceiving its own existence.

The whole argument about perception needing to exist “before” we can be conscious of ourselves as a perceiving being seems to me to confuse “before” in time with “before” in hierarchy. When the mind’s attention becomes directed toward a sufficiently abstract concept of the mind’s model of its own sense of self, then a feeling of self briefly arises in the mind. Like two mirrors lining up to reflect an infinite hallway, the levels of perception collapse into one dizzying feeling. I’m not conflating perception or theory of mind with self-perception.

Oh, apologies, I didn't mean you, I simply meant that philosophers who don't define their terms aren't doing their job properly.

>When I try to explain an answer to your objection, you respond with the same objection.

My objection is that you need to clarify what you mean, but you've just restated your argument in the same form. So again I'll ask - what is it in your immediate experience which provides evidence that the vast majority of your waking life is experienced as an automata? And I'll reiterate the point that a theory of mind and discursive thought =/= consciousness by pretty much all definitions. Consciousness is the immediate fact of my experiencing anything at all, thinking and reflecting on my existence as a subject relies upon the presence of consciousness itself, because if I was not conscious, I could neither think nor reflect on the fact that I am conscious.

Something that might help: Awareness/consciousness is the non-voluntary presence of sensory experience, thought and emotions. Attention is a focussing of awareness upon particular apparent features of that experience in a voluntary manner, requiring exertion of effort. Experience does not arise because I exert effort to pay attention to it (what is there prior to my effort that I can pay attention to, if attention creates experience?) any more than I exert effort to cause myself to wake up and fall asleep each night. Awareness is spontaneous, it does not require effort on my part - I do not *make* myself experience anything, experience simply occurs. I can, however, deliberately direct my attention to certain portions of my spontaneous experience in order to examine it more carefully, be that a sensory experience, a thought, or the very fact of my awareness itself. This awareness does not cease when I do not pay attention to it, for it is the very source of attention itself. Consciousness is prior to thought, awareness is prior to attention; in both cases, the latter depends upon the former for its existence, thus absence of the latter does not necessitate absence of the former. If you disagree with this assessment, I'd ask you to make clear for me again precisely what you mean by the terms ""consciousness"", ""attention"" and so on, as the explanation just offered is the common one utilising usual meanings.

philosophy	GearheadNation	"The view you’re responding to misses the mark in three counts.  First, it assumes that “economics “ is a human construct which it is not.  The conflict between wants and resources is fundamental to all the living.  To see it as a human construct forces one into the error of believing that we can create new economic systems based on philosophical principles.  Economics is not music, it is engineering and how long the system stands up and how well it operates is a direct function of how well we understand nature.  Now from the last 100 years it appears that maybe, just maybe, we understand nature well enough to lift the world population out of absolute poverty in the next 100 years.  We have also learned enough psychology to know that the human mind is so constructed that eradicating relative poverty is not possible.  Let me say that differently.  In the next 100 years we may be able to feed all, but it is not possible to prevent people from finding something to envy others about.

The first error leads to the second.  People want material comfort and security.  This is an ineradicable part of human nature.  While people may want the equality socialism promises, they will demand the material benefits capitalism provides.  They will go the party rally—and then buy/sell on the black market.  

What one and two lead to is the fallacy of the global proletariat takeover.  Capitalism wins because it provides the most for the most and by virtue of so doing it defends itself by supporting more efficient societies, stronger militaries, more robust social forces, etc.

philosophy	Raskalnekov	"I agree that the analysis of materialism didn't sound very convincing, but I think this is a better criticism of Marxism than you give it credit for. Or at least, a better criticism of a larger world philosophy that arguably underpins Marxism. Few have probably experienced the crushing pressures of capitalism more than natives, and capitalism touches virtually everything these days in destructive ways. But his point seems to be that for native people, Marxism has no better track record, and I would tend to agree with that. Marxism actively discourages spirituality/ religion, which is an intricate part of his culture. It also historically does not recognize native sovereignty any more than capitalism does, he brings up examples of the USSR and China to demonstrate this. While those examples tend to get old because they seem more like a missaplication of Marxism than the essence of it, I can understand his skepticism of Western systems given how none of them seem to have any desire to allow native culture to exist.

I think that this is less of a criticism of Marxism, and more of a criticism of European notions of rationality that support both Marxism and capitalism. I even feel a bit of Heideggerian thought in there, the criticisms of materialism seemed parallel to some of his concepts of standing reserve (though I am no expert on Heidegger so I could be wrong about this). I do get the sense that the ""more of the same"" idea is a bit reductionist, but for me it's understandable to not be trusting of a people who have historically committed genocide against your people. 

But I also think this applies mostly to certain forms of Marxism. I have no idea how it relates to anarchism, as I don't think anarchism would have the tools to export violence onto other cultures. I think that read a criticism of a certain kind of rationality, the arguments make a lot more sense and are a lot more powerful."	-3

""Epictetus presents the case of a father who, overwhelmed by emotion, abandons his sick daughter and refuses to return home until he learns that she is well. Like Socrates, Epictetus denied the possibility of akrasia (intemperance). They deny that someone can decide that a particular course of action is the better course and then not pursue it through weakness of will. Instead those who pursue a morally undesirable course assume that it is the best course for them. For Epictetus this is because they make incorrect use of their impressions. What needs to be done is to convince them that their assessment of the situation is wrong. This is illustrated by the manner in which Epictetus counsels the father who has abandoned his child, until he realises that he chose the wrong course of action (Diss. I. 11). Epictetus is also fond of using examples from literature: Paris runs away with Helen, the wife of his host Menelaus. If Menelaus had made correct use of his impressions, instead of going to war with Troy, he would have decided that he was better off being rid of such a wife (Diss. I. 28). Epictetus claims that a similar process would have prevented Medea from murdering her own children in order to wreak vengeance upon her husband, Jason (Diss. I. 28)."""	-12

I didn’t realize this is r/philosophy where it is exactly the point to argue this. Apologizes, as I was thinking of the spirit of what he was saying, not the nuances.**


I feel as thought you didn’t read all of what he said, or maybe you didn’t get the point. 

“But there is a peculiar behavior among most Caucasians. As soon as I become critical of Europe and its impact on other cultures, they become defensive. They begin to defend themselves. But I'm not attacking them personally; I'm attacking Europe. In personalizing my observations on Europe they are personalizing European culture, identifying themselves with it. By defending themselves in this context, they are ultimately defending the death culture. This is a confusion which must be overcome, and it must be overcome in a hurry. None of us has energy to waste in such false struggles. “

I don’t think he is referring to the point of Marxism/whatever fully, but the broader point is that the mindset of capitalism/European thinking is doing much more harm than good. 

Natives have had wars, battles, all sorts of normal things that most cultures have had over the millennia, sure. His broader point is that the respect for nature and human beings is different in the European thinking. This is a typical Native stance-respect for animals, Earth, and each other, maybe to a lesser degree, but respect nonetheless. Capitalism leads to death is a slippery slope, but if you look at the history of exploitation in the name of money and greed, you do witness the extent of damage that people can do to themselves and the world. Natives, for the most part, can cling to their concept that the respect for the natural world was far better and sustaining than the “European” model. 

I think he understands materialism quite well. It’s not about that at all. It’s about the mindset that the loss of respect for our environment can and will lead to worse things. Plenty of Indians murdered each other. Tribes didn’t exterminate each other for the sake of land to build condos or pollute on. Most tribes didn’t even have the concept of breaking a treaty until it was done to them. 

Saying a Native American has never experienced the crushing experience of capitalism is ignorant. If you’ve read any history or seen reservations, you’d know what the Native American has had to endure in the name of “capitalism”. 

It’s hard to even change that mindset or see a difference when you’re so oppressed or marginalized in just about everything you do. What other mindset could you have? 

Unfortunately, many people are so stuck in his defined  “European” mindset that they attack the nuances instead of the overall picture. Global warming is real. The rape and pillage of land is real. The exploitation of many cultures across the world for purely money is real. As human beings we should change it. Yet, we still stand here hoping someone else will, or that it’s not our problem personally because we cannot risk our positions, etc.

>They absolutely exist, hence, criminals who break out of society, or new emerging ""cliques"" of people, breaking away from the norms, decade fads etc.

These kinds of things aren't magic, they can all be explained as responses to social conditioning and incentives from society. The world is deterministic. 

> Individualists dont have a problem with inequality

I never even mentioned ""inequality"" specifically, this is a discussion about social morality in general, whether you believe in equality or not. Individualism is a worldview based in ignorance of the undeniable fact that societies constitute individual selves. It foolishly seeks to morally critique individuals without ever extending moral critique to the society that creates individual personalities and directs individual behaviors. There absolutely are non-egalitarians who understand this and hence reject individualism, like conservative traditionalists, and their critique of modern society mirrors that of leftists in many ways.

It was a double-win, cause he not only destroyed Peterson, he also got to sell his praxis and convert members of Peterson's base.

You are talking about behaviour - I'm asking you about your qualitative experience, phenomenal consciousness. What reason do you have to suppose this blinks in and out of existence when you're not paying attention to it?

> I can in retrospect because I know that the introspective process that gives rise to the feeling of selfhood that equals consciousness was not happening at the time.

Here you are conflating both possession of a theory of mind and active self-reflective awareness with consciousness itself. These are not the same thing. Babies and animals lack a theory of mind, an awareness of themselves as perceiving subjects, but most modern theories of mind and scientific fields relating to the same do in fact attributive subjective experience i.e. consciousness to babies and most animals. Self-reflective awareness is a higher-order cognitive process - for me to know ""I am perceiving"", I have to already be perceiving; the fact of experience is prior to my reflecting upon it. Consciousness is primary, ""I think therefore I am"" is secondary, derivative of this primary fact of consciousness.

>My experience is that in introspective moments — when “I think therefore I am” — my mind is having a transient experience of a feeling that just arose that moment. Granted, it took me several decades of introspection (and plenty of meditation) to see through the illusion of a continuous self.

Again, I'd argue that you are confusing discursive thought and self-reflective awareness with the very fact of consciousness and immediate experience itself. I am a Buddhist myself, so I'm perfectly happy to admit of the transient nature of my experience and the lack of a concrete, continuous ""self"", but that isn't what we're discussing - consciousness can lack a ""self"" but still be present throughout one's day, by virtue of the fact that experience occurs continuously throughout waking life and occasionally while sleeping, as in dreams.

>I strongly disagree that philosophy is specific about the meaning of words, particularly in this area.

Terms might be used differently by different theorists but they usually define their terms. Failure to do so is bad philosophy and would have the author rather soundly castigated by their peers. Usage of a word can be multiple but it must always be clarified by the user for the use in question. Admittedly this is perhaps one of the slipperiest of philosophical fields but that does not mean nobody is being clear about terms.

>I think I’ve tried hard to make clear what I mean by terms (as everyone writing in this area must). What I really mean is that it’s hard for me to respond to conclusory statements that you make (like that we continuously have subjective experience) that seem to me to be unsupportable, but seem to you to be self-evident.

They are self-evident when we get clear about what we mean. ""Attention"" is directed conscious awareness, ""experience"" is a diffuse fact of the presence of qualities in my general awareness. It is a categorical fact that while I am awake I am having experience - this is the definition of being awake; not being unconscious. Again, I would ask you to explain what portion of your experience gives evidence for 99% of your waking life being a yawning void of unconsciousness - both my immediate experience and introspection suggest otherwise. You are the one making claims about self-evident fact, I am merely pointing to consensus of both the common and scientific sort, as well as my own experience. As such, the burden of proof is on you, as the one making an exceptional claim.

Edit: I'm not sure how your theory is supposed to avoid the hard problem of consciousness. You admit that consciousness exists, just far less regularly than most think - this does not explain how and why consciousness arises from physical matter in the first place, which is the hard problem."	-10
philosophy	Keepmyhat	"Okay, then let me show the difference between these two concepts. I feel it would be fair to compare concepts, not flawed realisations of those concepts. So we ignore that mortality rate and conditions in soviet labor camps were pretty horrific (not intended by the concept), but we also ignore that in for example USA social mobility does not work as intended by the concept. So if some law exists, but is not enforced/has loopholes/generally ignored, we will look at the law. Basically looking at how it was supposed to work on paper

The best shortest read on ""labor duty"" is this Wiki page, however it only exists in Russian: https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C

I can't recommend you any literature in English on the subject, but I can translate key stuff for you as it transcribed in the laws of RSFSR.
1918 - labor duty established for everyone (everyone has to work goverment-mandated hours)
1919 - It is now illegal to quit your work or switch work on your own will. 
1920 - It is now illegal to skip a day.

I think the difference is fairly obvious. With this system you have zero control over where you work, your compensation, your location, your schedule. Not being in the system doesn't mean you just don't get paid - it is straight up illegal. And that is how it was supposed to be by the authors.

Now, pay-for-everything capitalist model is not pretty too, but here are freedoms it has over the ""universal labor duty"" model of 1918-1922 (in 1922 they limited it significantly, since then a civilian could only be conscripted to work on combating natural disasters and for most importand state tasks) RSFSR: freedom to negotiate your pay, freedom to choose how you earn, freedom to not work at all (yes if you have no passive income/assets you will starve, but if you have those you don't have to work unlike universal duty) or pursue education first, freedom to earn better shelter, food and health through more rewarding job etc. With universal labor at any time the state could tell every work-suited citizen to go anywhere and do anything and it would be straight up illegal not to comply.

Let me remind just in case that I absolutely despise ""pay or die"" attitude embraced by some of the modern capitalist countries. But I also believe 1918-1922 model of universal labor duty is demonstratably objectively worse in terms of freedom it allows an individual both in terms of present occupation, short and long term planning, etc.

Your summary for ""Capitalism"" is ""you have to work or be incredibly marginalized and frequently jailed in society."" is fair, even though it ignores the fact that you don't have to work if you have assets/passive income. It would be perfectly fair if it said ""have money"" instead of ""work""

Because the Zizek debate is fresh in my mind, and he demonstrated a very reactionary reading of socialist causes that doesn't actually strike to the heart of socialist criticism.

Peterson is a reactionary dipshit that only got a rise to fame by questioning trans people's civil rights and framing our struggles in the tradition of cisgender psychologists calling us all insane. He deserved none of his rise to position of speaker for disenfranchised white men looking for something to target with their anger, and he'll fall back into obscurity in soon enough now that Zizek called him out on his bullshit in a way that he couldn't frame as adversarial.

Absolute power corrupts absolutely, it will inevitably become corrupt, as all things do.  

So in the end, you have a system where when it fails its never its own fault, thus requires more of itself to be succesful, else its not really what it claims/claimed to be, it must he absolutely powerful, which will inevitably become corrupt, and it will do this faster and faster like a snowball going downhill....  I believe Marx had atleast the idea that socialism was a mere transition from capitlism to communism right.  Given those 3 problems, it should always be transitioning to more socialistic ideas, but never attaining true communism because that is technically impossible.

That said, I dont think we can have a serious discussion about socialism, or socialist policies, until we address the dangers of socialism.   Until that discussion is had on a national level, the nation cant risk going towards socialist policies.

The truth is just a structural gate towards new stuff. We are not truth seekers in the first place, but explorers, and the need for truth comes with the territory. It's intrinsic to, but not identical with our main drive.	3

philosophy	ManticJuice	"> I don’t at all think my theory is “above criticism.” That’s why I started that sentence with “it seems to me.” 

My point is that if your theory requires ""no further explanation"", it is simply an opinion, not a theory, as theories require some degree of testability, either in empirical experimentation or through my direct, immediate experience. You have given me no reason to suppose your theory is true other than the fact that it might be possible, but it also might be possible that a malicious demon has fabricated this world and implanted false memories into my mind - mere possibility is not a reliable guide to whether or not something is true. Both my own experience and the empirical science seem to suggest that subjective experience is continuous while awake, while attention can be directed within that experience to attend to different features of it. You will have to explain why you believe this to be false.

> Your analysis does not connect with my experience of existence or the way I am using the terms and concepts involved

You will have to clarify your use of terms, then, as philosophy is quite specific about the meanings of words and if we are not using them in the same way then we can't have a meaningful, productive conversation. I'm curious as to what aspects of your experience involve reality blinking out of existence when you're not paying attention, though - by your own admission there is no subjectivity without observation, so how can you observe the presence of an unobserved/non-existent portion of your life; how can you know when you are an automata?"	-1
philosophy	Primeinlife_oldfart	"In many things we examine, there is only one outcome, to that we refer to as the fact that is truthful. These facts make up premises and we draw conclusions - and if we follow the premises correctly there should be only one item we arrive at that the facts bear out as true. Hence it is the ""truth"" .... for now.

However, this is based on the preponderance of information and the more we learn (measure) the greater our scope becomes. It could come that, as quasars have exhibited, there are double states and remote states that can and do exist BUT, we do not know how to measure or identify these states correctly so, at this time, we go with what we can to retain sanity and constancy."	3

He’s very widely known for making sensational and controversial claims, and often promoted them in public as if they’re settled issues. He’s a very successful physicist in some respects and has had some positive impacts (like the founding of the perimeter institute), but he’s pretty crazy.

Replace your last sentence with “seems like a small fraction of scientists have a penchant for making cavalier claims that belie the spirit of science and are widely published because sensational/controversial statements draw more readers, making them seem more common than they really are.”

That said (having not read the article), I do agree with the title in a way: science works because scientists care enough to understand how the world works that they are willing to work their butts off to figure it out. While they will never find an absolute, objective truth, they are nonetheless pursuing truth in some sense, getting closer and closer."	9

If a tragedy is a side-effect of a good system, then tunnel-vision causes people to forget the system and its value.  Answers to the ""what can we do to prevent this?"" question are sometimes ridiculously myopic.  The authors didn't consider the psychological effects of negative emotions."	0
philosophy	Bunerd	"Doesn't understand materialism, too stubborn to try. Cool. Somehow thinks ""materialism"" means you can murder people. I can tell you that there are ethical materialists and self-centered spiritualists. Actually moreso, since materialists tends to be determinists, they tend to see the world outside of themselves more clearly, whereas spiritualists can see their actions as guided by outside forces and approved by those outside forces. It's just really silly to me reading someone say something to the essence of ""I don't dehumanize people, unlike all those Europeans.""

The thing about Marx was that he was studying capitalism and looking at how its profit motive could infect everything. That capitalism cares more about profit than people, and if the people want to fight back, they need to team up. They'll drive pipes of oil through your lands and not give a shit about you living there, because it makes the spirit of their bank account larger. We can talk about the material benefits, but there are none. Just numbers on a machine somewhere counting up to extinction. The value of which is only believed in, accepted as a facet of this world, but wholly ephemeral. It evaporates on inspection like the rest of faith.

A statement like ""Marx is as alien to me as capitalism is"" is just like, ""duh,"" cause if you've never experienced the crushing pressures of capitalism on everything it touches, then the material analysis of that practices just seem like gibberish. ""I don't know what it is but I don't like it"" is reactionary, and going back to leaning on tradition is further reactionary. Going back to assert the sovereignty of your people, your tribe, or your nation, when it's challenged by the international force of capitalism is silly and ineffective; better, stronger nations have tried and all of them fail, because surprise, traditions and nationalism are super easy to exploit with a capitalist mindset. And yeah, people in the margins of society or crushed under its weight can totally have these reactions like everyone else can, it's just super unhelpful.

philosophy	ManticJuice	">  I got the impression that the article equivocates precisely because it makes no difference between just or real punishment and actions that are called punishment but actually serve something entirely different such as oppressing people to maintain the current regime or whatever. 

But again, you're calling just punishment ""real"" punishment and other forms of punishment ""something else"", which is precisely what I warned against. Our notions of justice are historically conditioned and retroactively applying them to the entirety of human history is to misunderstand the role of both justice and punishment. If there is some objective sense of justice it may turn out that punishment plays no part in it, that punishment is simply a social regulatory mechanism which imposes a collective will upon a transgressive individual through coercive force which in and of itself is an unjust action; other avenues of dealing with anti-social behaviour may turn out to be more objectively just than punishment. Would you then be happy to say that what we do now is not really punishment?

>The motives behind these actions are different.

You'll have to justify that claim. All punishments are enacted in order to enforce social and cultural norms. Whether or not that is backed by a historically conditioned notion of justice is a contingent feature, not a necessary one. You need to point to some objective feature of justness and the punishments it enacts versus those which are unjust and make it one which is historically stable, or else justice remains a contingent and conditioned feature of those enacting what they see to be punishments."	3
philosophy	ManticJuice	"> I have no evidence of having a subjective experience most of the time.

Every waking moment you experience subjective experience. Both memory and immediate experience attest to the relative continuity of subjective experience in waking life.

>I don’t even know what it means to talk about unobserved subjectivity.

I think you're confusing awareness/subjective experience with attention. We are aware i.e. have subjective experience more or less continuously throughout our waking lives - this is the field of experience through which we move. Within this field, our attention roams, from thoughts to sensations to emotions and back. This attention is singular and focussed. However, the content of experience remains present when the attention is directed elsewhere. My peripheral vision tells me that my sense of sight does not annihilate when I am focussed upon this screen in front of me - I can still see the room existing about me. Likewise, when attention focuses upon some feature of my experience, the rest does not annihilate. When attention disperses, I in fact experience *more*, not less - an open awareness allows experience to be perceived unfilitered, in a holistic manner, rather than in the discriminatory and selective manner afforded by close attention to something. Simply not paying attention to some feature of experience does not cause it to cease to exist - any meditator will tell you that allowing the focus of attention to loosen, to disperse and become unfocused and general actually deepens our degree of consciousness, it does not make experience fade into the background, as would occur on your conflation of focussed attention with conscious experience itself.

>My theory seems to me to be far simpler, to fully explain my experience, and to not require any further explanation. 

That's a pretty handy way to say your theory is unverifiable and thus totally above criticism. I'd suggest that your theory does not accord with most modern psychology and neuroscience, which absolutely does not suggest that people lack subjective experience the vast majority of the time. Your theory is far less simple than you imagine, as it entails that the world of experience is entirely dependent upon the active attention of a perceiving mind, and is not passively received by minds in their awareness due to the interaction of physiology and environment. A world which blinks in and out of existence because it requires attention to exist is a far less stable and self-evident claim than you make it out to be, in part, I think, due to your confusion of attention and awareness. Awareness is continuous, it is what makes subjectivity ""observed"" - attention is focus upon particular aspects of our experience, which may highlight some feature and make others fade into the background, but a lack of attention to a thing does not cause it to annihilate from our experience entirely, but simply to recede into the background of awareness.

Instead, she considered herself as a writer, commentator and novelist. Beauvoir’s identification should not, however, discredit her as a philosopher. Jean-Paul Sartre’s work on existentialism is heavily indebted to Beauvoir’s careful eye and scholarly expertise, and her book *The Ethics of Ambiguity*, is considered by many as one of the most significant texts in moral philosophy and existentialism; the ethical text which Sartre promised, but never produced.

However, I’ve met a handful of people, both professors and students, who reiterated that the career prospects of philosophy graduates are not as low as it’s perceived to be.

Philosophy majors are generally equipped with refined transferable skills (i.e. critical, analytical, and research skills). It depends on the individual themselves to decide where they want to utilise these skills. 

Admittedly, most philosophy majors I know tend to pursue two majors to increase their chances of securing a job after graduation. At the end of the day, though, it really is relative to each person and their interests."	5
philosophy	Mechasteel	"Science doesn't care about the truth. Consider the scientific method, and also how scientists behave. Science is about making precise, accurate predictions. Scientists will tell you how fast the apple will fall, track it to the millimeter -- but whether gravity is caused by God pulling the apple, or by the universe expanding, or some unknown quantum mechanism, those are irrelevant unless they also make some predictions. It's very satisfying to have a sensible model for how something works, but the science part is all about the predictions.

This is part of the problem between religion and science, and why people talk past each other on that topic. To a scientist, a good explanation is something that makes good predictions. To a storyteller, a good explanation is something that sounds nice and isn't too obviously inconsistent with the known facts nor too complicated. Imagine trying to disprove the [The Legend of How the Bear Lost His Tail](http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/the-legend-of-how-the-bear-lost-his-tail/) by talking about genetics."	12

philosophy	rayjensen	Nietzsche would have argued that GEM Anscombe has no place in philosophy because she’s a women. Beyond that I think she based a lot of her moral beliefs on Christianity.

philosophy	Georgie_Leech	"The post prior to the one I responded to was pointing the finger at some pretty unpleasant human behaviours being rooted in survival mechanisms: ""Life requires energy and energy requires killing something. As a creature with intelligence we've evolved all sorts of tricks to ensure that we survive at all costs: including lying cheating, stealing, & murder...and it's never going to go away.""

In other words, any system is going to need to deal with the fact that some people will attempt to use underhanded means to achieve their ends. That is, that some will exploit others for gain if they can. 

Marxist ideologies aren't immune to this, which is relevant for a discussion on whether any means are justified for just ends. The challenge is to overthrow a system of exploitation, so just ends would imply installing a system free of exploitation. If exploitation originally arises from human desires rather than human systems (which seems reasonable; we didn't exactly evolve from apes with systems of governance already existing), a better system would seem to require what amounts to biological reprogramming.

YMMV on this point. I can't say I hold such a pessimistic view of human nature, as we also have some pretty hard-wired cooperation instincts. I just think that one should argue with points actually being made re: practicality vs permissibility, rather than whichever happens to be more convenient."	3

philosophy	tripperjack	"Not all hard determinists would say punishing criminals, such as with long prison sentences, is *wrong*. For example, the late William Provine, who did not believe in any ultimate foundation for ethics, described prison as a stupid, inefficient system that created worse-acting citizens than before they went in. 

One may use the  language of ""should"" as a shorthand for ""I would prefer if"", or because it is operational in getting people to do what you want, since *they* still believe in the existence of shoulds.

Engineering humanity (which I took to mean engineering cultural and political structures) doesn’t have to completely eliminate basic human nature in order to produce forms that vary widely in their desirability, regardless of whether you desire some massively unequal capitalist system or a more egalitarian social democracy.

Saying that we can’t achieve a traditional Marxist utopia without re-engineering human biology/neurology may be true, but there are other attainable social forms that we can achieve.

We see papers make it to top journals (Nature Cell Science especially) that later turn out to be irrelevant or out right false. The core issue being that any group can experimentally show “clear data” implicating that ‘x’ is a major contributor to phenomenon ‘y’ which also happens to fit in nicely with what’s being said by community experts. 
 
Ultimately, scientific progress is more or less based on community consensus and the understanding that most, if not everything, might be completely false. However, science is still able to move forward because theres no harm in assuming the previous experiments are true. If it is true, then we can do experiment ‘a’ to confirm from another angle, or reproduce their data and go on from there."	4

philosophy	eduardogfma	"My aim with the reading suggestions was not to start a parallel discussion about objectivity. I was simply trying to illustrate my point that the methods/processes/dogmas in scientific research are contradictory with the generalised idea that science cares purely about truth, and that it is always open to discussion. 

&#x200B;

More, the claim ""Science Works Because We Care to Know the Truth"" illustrates, in my opinion, a lot of problems about how we regard science nowadays. First, there is this idea that everything that it is not scientific has no value, or at least belongs to a lower rank. Well, are philosophy, history, and art lesser domains than science? Second, it illustrates how science practitioners look at it. That is, something that gives one superhuman legitimacy (as Yuval puts it, a religion). Third, it is not clear that science works **because** we care to know the truth. Science works. But many times for it to work humans must resort to correlations (this is true for any scientific branch, from heat transfer, to biology, to medicine), which by definition do not prove causality and do not enlighten us about the physical events being studied. Take for instance the way models are being built resorting to machine learning/autonomous systems where a very complex model is devised based on real data, but no new information is added to our understanding about the very system that is being modelled. The models/processes work. Very well in most cases. We just do not understand why.

&#x200B;

Notwithstanding, there exists in scientific circles/communities a clear hierarchy (or status system) very similar to religious/political institutions. More, researchers are judged very often by the number of publications, not by its quality. One can argue that this is due to people not science itself, i.e. that any system where people interact is bound to operate over a social status system. But I maintain my claim that science is not such a cold, rational, truth oriented domain.

I don't know all the specifics, but the end goal is no suffering whatsoever. For *any* sentient thing.

philosophy	Cole4Christmas	well someone clearly watched the newest JoJo episode	1
philosophy	Kenthur	A lot of this discussion about Objective Reality has one massive flaw; It's not discussing the thing itself and its state. A lot is based on the 'facts' as they are known to the observer and assume one incorrect thing, that the observations and known 'facts' to the observers are true and accurate, and that two different observations, made differently, are both true in both different observation types (that experiment A's outcome B, is also true in experiment X, and X's outcome of Y is true in experiment A). This doesn't indicate some nefariousness on the part of the observer, but it points to a problem with the assumptions in the methods used, or an absence of thought on the matter. The reality is, that scientifically, if you have two opposed outcomes to the same experiment, you suspend judgement until you can solve the issue, you don't say its just a 'fact' and that's that; In the examples given in some of the articles linked above it points to an experiment that has observers at different distances therefore giving different results, but if they were at the same distance, or if Ceteris paribus is employed like it should be, then the results would/should/may be the same. The reality is it hasn't touched on objective reality, but these things have only demonstrated relativism and it's importance in how facts are interpreted, it doesn't even address the underlying subject of facts, only their interpretation, and so saying its a debate in, or proof against, objective reality is an invalid argument. If the experiments were accurate they would include that 'Under condition A you get B, and under condition X you get Y' and then try and explore why. I do agree though that this is a product of sensationalism to try and get more funding,  ultimately to sound like they're doing something, but that aside I think resolving the methodical issues involved in it will better science and so are important to explore.	21

philosophy	Annathematic	"Objectivity is relative. In other words, if we could not perceive it as separate from us, then it we would no longer have a subjective perception of it. 

For instance, there is a silver maple tree at the back of my yard. If it were to fall, it would possibly damage parts of my house. It shows no sign of falling, but if I cut it down, I would then remove it’s objective potential to cause any damage. I would then weigh the potential of each scenario, and given my inclination, I might leave the tree to it’s own. In either case, the outcome might be that the integrity of the tree is compromised, and might eventually necessitate my response.

While this scenario does not remove the tree’s objectivity, neither does it remove my subjectivity in regards to it. 

So while you say that we can not derive (by this I think you mean ascribe or attribute) need to do something from something physical, I would say that we have no other recourse but to derive a necessity from anything physical to at least remain as we perceive it to be.

If an object changes, we might not be able to ascribe any moral objective in it’s functions, but rather we should think of it as our incomprehension of it’s objective functions regarding it’s own integrity."	-6
philosophy	eugenejwallace	So genetics is determined by your parents and any random mutations. Past experiences is the environment accumulating after being processed through your genetics and any already accumulated past experiences. Meaning both of these whilst are internal to us as a human are completely determined by the external causes. One being our parents, the other is the environment. Does that make sense? Again I think the language of external and internal sources of cause doesn’t really assist the argument here. The main point being that it’s the combination of these causes or shall we say variables which gives us one fixed outcome, not the ability to freely choose among any as held by libertarianism.	6

>Interestingly for an orthodox school of Indian philosophy, early iterations of Nyaya didn't mention deities, so they were probably non-theistic or agnostic.

One clarification on this point. The early Nyāyikas held the Vedas to be authoritative, so it is highly unlikely that they didn't believe in the devas. The question of atheism for them regarded the existence of an *Īśvara*, an all powerful creator like the in the Abrahamic conception.

Early Nyāya scholars considered the hypothesis of Īśvara. However, the early Nyāya scholars rejected this hypothesis, and were non-theistic or atheists. Later Nyāyikas reconsidered this question and offered counter arguments on this point."	7

philosophy	Morgowitch	In the contrary I couldn't imagine the feeling of free will. What would that imply? That one can decide what to think, that there is some magical force inside us that we have to control to make decisions? But where would that control come from if not out of a deterministic system? There's a lot that I feel very strange about regarding anything else than determinism. The implications that non determinism brings with itself are way stranger than anything else I believe.	1
philosophy	Annathematic	"Objectivity is relative. In other words, if we could not perceive it as separate from us, then we would no longer have a subjective perception of it. 

For instance, there is a silver maple tree at the back of my yard. If it were to fall, it would possibly damage parts of my house. It shows no sign of falling, but if I cut it down, I would then remove it’s objective potential to cause any damage. I would then weigh the potential of each scenario, and given my inclination, I might leave the tree to it’s own.

philosophy	Rajarshi1993	"The *Nyaya* school was made obsolete by the *Vaishishika* school, which was in turn made obsolete by the *Samkhya* and the *Mimamsa* schools. 
Those two competed for dominance for a while before *Vedanta* emerged as a combination of *Samkhya* with some ideas adapted from Buddhism.
As of now, there is little interest in *Nyaya*. The main schools of philosophy are *Samkhya* and *Vedanta*. 
*Mimamsa* is largely obsolete, but some of its contributions, such as the theory of *Purushartha*, remain."	-3
philosophy	Kofilin	"Okay well if I try to be a little more lenient with words I would say that all motives are irrational. Including the basic ""necessities"" of survival.

If I'm even more lenient with words and just magically define ""rational"" as the value-accumulating selfish homo-economicus, which indeed seems to be the working definition here, then yeah, society is largely ungrateful to those not following this lifestyle. As it always has been, everywhere. It's only in brief flashes that individualists suffered in history, while collectivists, nationalists and so on ""sacrifice"" themselves with glee."	-1
philosophy	Blue_Catastrophe	That’s an interesting point, but I don’t really buy the assertion that individualists have been largely successful in the greater span of history (I feel like the current moment is almost uniquely individualistic.) Do you have notable examples? It seems to me that most of the most successful and long-lasting societies and empires survived largely on the back of collective identity and group sacrifice (Rome is a great example, and only fell apart when the expansive nature of the empire and political strife of the time destroyed their collective identity as citizens of Rome.)	15
philosophy	Seanay-B	This is anecdotal, but as an undergrad there was a fair amount of interest in Nyaya/Vaishishikas (though I think prof spelled it differently)	3

This was a landline only poll. In other words, they called the demographic that they know would be more likely to support Biden. And he's still under 50%. 

This is like calling Green Bay Packers fans and asking what they think of Brett Farve. Maybe a bunch will dislike him now, but you're guarenteed to get a decent percentage that loves him. And then I can run an article that says ""39% of people polled want Brett Farve back!"" Without mentioning that I only asked the group I knew would contain those people.

The more subjective qualities of trust and likeability, or inconsistencies in a candidate's interview answers vs their platform vs their record, would be virtually impossible to use in a consistent, scientific way. iSideWith will match you to the candidates who most align with you, anyone over 85% IMO is a realistic option.

Bern is tough. I'm not saying that would happen. 

But I am saying this is democratic politics. You build the best platform you can, out of WHOEVER you can. 

Yangs platform is Bernie's pretty much, except he also covers areas Bernie misses, crucially automation. 

So merge the two. Give yangs youth the lead, and you neutralize any disadvantage of Bernie's age, while also still having him in the perfect position to actually reform things. 

Again, this is a democracy. If you think one person is alone is going to be able to save us, then it's not me that thinks like a Trump supporter. 

Doesn't have to be Yang though. I do think that's the best platform for the country, but there are others that would win.

Tell that to the people who are under-insured and go broke everyday with huge medical bills. Tell that to 30+ thousands of dead people that die every year because they couldn't go to the doctor because they don't have health insurance. I lived through a 2 year war in Kosovo and only 25+ thousand people died in that war. In America, more people die in a year than in war zones. But, please, do tell me we need civility.

SandersForPresident	HugeAlps	"No offense but it's clear you haven't done any research on Yang and you're just talking out of your ass re: his policy. I'm not even really a supporter but your comment is really biased. 

""Maybe he supports it maybe he does not..."" except he has a detailed policy page (more policy and more details/facts than Bernie's page, by the way). Medicare for all has been a key part of his campaign since early on, has been featured on his website for months, and is still there - go check for yourself before straight up lying to people. He clearly supports it. 

Why do you think Yang is against vocational training? He's made many statements regarding workers moving into new industries because of automation. Automation and AI is a central part of Yang's campaign, why are you saying he has given up? He's just addressing the same problem in a different way.

Honestly, I was on the fence with Bernie, your comment has pushed me over the edge, not voting for him. Why lie about other candidates when you could just speak to the good of your own? Disgraceful."	5

He’s a household politician name that middle aged democrats will vote for in the primary because he’s a safe bet and they “trust” him, he has experience in the White House, etc. who cares that he’s bought by corporate interests? The DNC will push him and slander Bernie until Biden is the primary winner.

He’s also closely related to the right’s least favorite person: Obama. So waves of conservatives will turn out to support trump against him, and boom, we have 4 more years of the orange clown."	8
SandersForPresident	Maniak_	">I dont think his platform gets new voters but is trying to consolidate a base that keeps him ahead.

Especially since his platform is non-existent.

""I'm against bad things, vote for me because Obama"" is hardly the most convincing platform in the race.

And then, there's his record. And then, there's his habit of showing how full of shit he is whenever he opens his mouth. The first debate might be fun.

There's work to do but there's no reason to panic. All of this was expected since the very start."	-8

SandersForPresident	LibertarianBerner	"Somewhere near 1/3 close to 100 million Americans have no health care or cannot afford their health insurance. Cancer patients are dying every day from lack of insurance. Most of us know someone who has cancer or someone who is about to enter medical bankruptcy because they cannot afford their insurance.

And even us that can afford our insurance are paying for almost nothing. Many are diagnosed with cancer and find their current insurance is not adequate to cover a life debilitating illness. Also we could greatly reduce the rate at which people are diagnosed with cancer and other diseases if everyone had access to routine checkups from a doctor.

 It’s much cheaper for all us to guarantee that ALL Americans have healthcare guaranteed from birth. This would greatly reduce the rate at which people are diagnosed with costly diseases later in life.

 Preventative coverage, and education from a doctor on diet and exercise, greatly reduces the chances that folks will he diagnosed with a disease or serious health issues later in life that will be 1000000 times more expensive to give them health care."	-2

I’d love to see her on the ticket with Bernie. Right now it is in both their interests that they do well. Warren can grow her following by taking Harris, Biden , Beto, Buttigieg supporters when those supporters realize how weak those candidates are once you go past their rhetoric.

Here they are gearing up for it again. Literally every single other Dem, including huge names like Harris, Booker, Sanders, they all started at low numbers, and have had to build up. Bern is at 15% now like you said. Yang is sitting at like what 3%? After a long campaign he's gotten that high.

You combat this with the fact that prisoners who can’t vote are taken into account population wise when the census is being taken for re-districting. He needs to point out the 13-15th amendments. This country is caught up in the bullshit question and forgetting the message as a whole. This shit is EXACTLY what happened last time and it looks like the establishment is winning again.

Bernie’s stance on trade is similar to an America first trump kind of policy. We’ve got all these workers in America who want to work: what if we invested more in American workers to produce clothing, farming, etc and stopped depending so much on China for everything. What if we stopped giving so much to corporations that pillage America and gave more to unions that protect the workers and the industries?"	4

SandersForPresident	elrod_enchilada	"Translation: Don’t expect this to get much (or any) attention on MSNBC, CNN, NPR, the N.Y. Times or Washington Post.

The truth about Bernie throughout his career has been that he has done extremely well with independents, far better than the conventional wisdom can countenance. 

In corporate media world, independents are this massive block of voters wedged between Democrats and Republicans. They think Democrats are too left on some issues and republicans are too right on some issues. They therefore flip flop between the parties depend upon which party gets closest to their beloved center.

This is nonsense. Independents are not crazed fools switching from Obama to the Tea Party And back again every two years. They defy facile categorization and while they care about politics they are willing to not vote if they don’t like the choices. They tend to like Bernie. A lot. 

But in the conventional wisdom the most electable Democrat is always the one who is the most moderate and closest to the so-called center.

In the real world this conventional wisdom does not hold up, and Bernie’s constant and immense appeal to independents is exhibit A. It is why Bernie would have defeated Trump in 2016 and has the best chance to demolish him in 2020. 

Why does this flawed reasoning survive and go unchallenged in the corporate media? Well it is not  a coincidence that the beloved center invariably maps to ground zero of corporate America’s interests."	12
SandersForPresident	Oxbinder	"I agree, there were a lot of assumptions made by the campaign about the knowledge level of the attendees.  I hosted, but it was the first time I've ever been involved in any campaign, beyond the donating money/voting/bumper sticker level.

I sought info from some attendees who had canvassed before, but I don't think they understood how little I knew about how volunteering works, and so they weren't a lot of help to me.

I was just reminded on this site about the kurfluffle back in 2016 when Bernie got locked out of VAN for a few days.  It makes everything so much more clear!"	2

Every campaign does this. Every petition and nonprofit collects this information. We can have a larger discussion on whether campaigns and nonprofits should collect all this information or if your name and age should be publicly identifiable information on the internet, but it’s unrelated to Bernie’s campaign. 

TLDR: All of this information is available to the public. Whether you think this kind of information should be public is a larger discussion for the entire internet and a discussion about ALL political campaigns and petitions on the right and the left storing this kind of data."	4
SandersForPresident	bobbarkerfan420	it’s early, and clearly we have work to do. nothings impossible and we’ve overcome a lot before; that’s all this polls is saying	1
SandersForPresident	mnbvcxz123	">Democrats have been trying to push bills for campaign finance reform for years only to have them blocked by Republicans.

This is a strange thing to single out.  Dems are broadly in favor of this since it would improve their position in elections.   They are also broadly in favor of things like not requiring voter ID for the same reason.  No mystery here. 
 
But if you look at the major elements of Sanders platform, things like Medicare for all, college for all, Green New Deal, and other stuff, you will find that he is bucking the party leadership and most of the other candidates (with some welcome and honorable exceptions) in every case.  A few days ago, there was a now-famous article in the New York Times about party leaders (Pelosi and Schumer), rich donors, and mayor Pete having ongoing meetings in New York to discuss ways to sabotage Sanders' campaign and get someone else to be the nominee.

Voter rolls are public, and the Democratic Party has long been aggregating additional information about voters to aid with fundraising and turnout operations, data that all major campaigns have access to. The difference is that the Sanders app democratizes the process with the goal of expanding the electorate, while the party operations are aimed at identifying existing supporters so they can be motivated to vote. The party data is generally available to campaign volunteers, but because Sanders lowers the bar to volunteering, more people will now have access to the data. The goal, though, is to get more people to vote for Sanders, not to attack Sanders opponents.

Bernie Sanders is just one person making his voice heard in a problematic world. That does not make him a goddamn messiah. It is easy to exalt some people over others, and it is easy to generalize situations that we are outside of. Your understanding is limited to the information you allow yourself to have. This is a trapping of human psychology but it has to be overcome for real progress to happen.

The reality is that most people are good and work towards good things. The forces that concentrate power and catalyze misery and oppression are a devious minority in the world. To say that “everyone else” outside of some ridiculously narrow, self-defined camp is “just talk” is inaccurate and naive.

SandersForPresident	ryeguytheshyguy	"Yes.  Because polls are only good when they show bernie ahead. Did Bernie outperform some polls? yes. But only a couple. You could say right now it's a bit early for polling because there haven't been debates, but don't fool yourself these polls are fairly accurate. I mean you can't cherry pick, because I could say the polls that show bernie ahead with minorities is just dead wrong because they didn't call people with Samsung Galaxy s9+ phones at 5pm, after school, when the majority would answer. So stop it with the whole, ""they didn't even call cellphones so it only represents old Biden supports, bro"""	-5

How you feel about about 28% vs 20% in a field of 20 candidates is completely subjective. You feel that's huge, others wouldn't. The other 18 candidates are polling an order of magnitude lower than the front runners.

More importantly to me is that when someone says ""feel the Bern"" what I feel they are talking about is the excitement they feel for Sanders.

Many people feel excited that there might be a candidate that has decades of fighting for issues they agree with. They feel excited because in Sanders they see someone who upset the status quo in 2016 and shows no signs of stopping. They see someone who has earned our trust.

Who is excited for Biden?

Obviously they exist, I have just never met them. What are they excited about, what vision does he have that is getting people amped? What did he work on while VP that he now needs to go back and finish? What are his policies?

SandersForPresident	sanemaniac	I encourage you to research the felony disenfranchisement policies of other developed countries. The vast majority have policies that are much more “generous” than ours to prisoners, but they will exercise it if the cases are very egregious, like in the example you mentioned. It is not necessarily all or nothing, for instance someone who engages in election fraud should rightly have their right to vote suspended. However a lifetime ban for felony drug possession? Comparatively pretty insane. There is a sliding scale here and room for compromise.	-6

Gotta work hard until then."	1
SandersForPresident	sanemaniac	This is a Bernie activist subreddit. There are plenty of other subreddits built for political debate but I think this graphic, for the venue, is a fine summation of this  issue. It is not very nuanced or very complicated and the majority of the developed world agrees: a prisoner should only be disenfranchised except in the most extreme of circumstances.

People are slowly starting to wake up to the truth about getting fleeced by them and are growing more aware and angry about it of late. The problem is there's not enough direction of what the consumer can actually do about it.

If you bring up Hillary in these parts, well, I'm not even going to elaborate on the hate spew the Trump administration has done Bernie a favor about when it comes to Hillary. I hope it's a blessing in disguise in the long run up to 2020, but I also fear that the msm coverages you mentioned will be the force to be reckoned with when it comes to common sense voting vs. political party loyalty in 2020. 

A real helpful topic that doesn't get much traction is the removal of the Electoral College we have in place now and the re-evaluation of electronic voting machines that are relied upon to cast ballots with all their faults.

Others will continue running negative campaigns and using tactics like unflattering photos, but the whole idea is that **we don't need to be like them to beat them.**"	6

SandersForPresident	InterdimensionalTV	I can agree with that. If I'm voting Bernie I'm doing it because I want a president that seems to care more directly about myself and those around me. I don't see him as anti-establishment, I see him as more pro-individual in the sense that he's more worried about the citizens at large.	1

Whether it’s a trip to Disneyworld/land, or just watching Finding Nemo 30 times, nearly every kid in America grows up feeling that Disney is a warm friend.

SandersForPresident	MrVolcanoes22	"""Outside the restaurant industry, companies like Bank of America and Target have been hiking internal minimum wages to attract and retain employees in a tight labor market. Similarly, 87% of survey respondents affected by minimum wage hikes said that they increased wages for workers who made more than the minimum wage.""

You support Andrew Yang, who in turn supports UBI, the same arguments can be made against that and a living wage, difference is your candidate doesn't want to promise medicare for all , but a ""public option"", he doesn't support free college, just ""controlled"" tuition which doesn't solve the spiraling debt crisis, and many other issues. I doubt people on this sub will have a problem with a civil discussion on policy, but showing up just to link a cnbc article indirectly shitting on Sanders policy? Come on now :/

And on the subject of UBI, I actually love the idea! And hope that Yang is able to push UBI into the mainstream, I also recognize however that a large problem with American voters is they tend to be single-issue voters. I'm for UBI, but I'm also for the policies I noted above, and a host of other issues that Bernie has been clear on, Yang also supports the legalization of marijuana, etcetera etcetera, UBI is probably the only position he has that Bernie doesn't that I would pick him over Bernie, I even went to his page, love the stuff on ""human centered capitalism"" he hits on the very important subject that our economic health is measured by GDP and not factors that affect regular people. On basically everything else either they share common views or Bernie is better (see policies above). So I'll vote for Bernie, and if  you want to have an actual discussion, please at least ask for it in your post, don't just drop a news article and run."	23

SandersForPresident	tovversh	Most people aren't paying attention.  Biden burned out on three Presidential runs before.  He's just benefiting from having been the VP.  Once people start looking into his background and the more his foot in the mouth disease starts hitting Democratic constituencies, he'll start to fade.  He's never really been vetted before.  Right now, it's just us hyper political folks tracking the details, but now that he's in the race officially, he'll have to deal with the new political realities, and he's already done a good job of showing us that he's not ready for them.	3

SandersForPresident	tovversh	Exactly, this is not the time to go toxic on our friends.  Let Warren run and push issues that work for us all.  She's put out some stuff that I hope Bernie takes a good look at to be honest.  It also allows her to take some of the heat for over extending herself.  We also need all of her people willing to move to our side if she drops out.  I'm confident she will do that if she can't break above single digits before Iowa, so why try alienating her and her supporters now?	8

SandersForPresident	tovversh	"We should get used to this for a while.  With such a large selection of candidates, only the most committed to one or another position are really settled in.  Bernie's got his old core supporters, Biden has scooped up the core of the Clinton/Obama folks.  Everyone else is in flux, trying out one and another of the myriad choices.  It's not surprising.  The good news is that the cast is pretty much set, and we'll get to start to see thing settling out.  After the first couple of debates we'll probably start to see also ran's dropping out and where their support goes.  I think that Bernie will benefit the most from that as a lot of the candidates are trying to edge in on the progressive wing of the party and their supporters will round to Bernie, if we don't scare them off first.  

So, yeah, for the next couple of months I don't see the polls moving much unless someone starts pulling out the knives.  I still think that Bernie doesn't have as many vulnerabilities that way, but we'll have to see what is out there."	8

SandersForPresident	tovversh	Yeah, it's so much more than one detail.  The prisoner voting rights is just one part of the whole voter suppression program.  Given the modern realities, Bernie is on the right side.  The forces of darkness have used the legal system to disenfranchise far too many people, but it's easy to focus on the one part that is the most controversial.  Bernie needs to frame the issue of prisoner voting as part of the campaign against voter suppression and restoration of everyone's right to vote.  If he lets the issue dangle on it's own, it will just cause more damage, unfortunately.	-3

Mouseketeers and Racketeering if you get what I'm saying!"	0
SandersForPresident	tovversh	That's right!  Warren is on the right side of history, she's got great ideas, and Bernie will need her to help him once he wins this race.  We will need her supporters to win, both the nomination and the general election.  Be smart people!	11
SandersForPresident	Liquor_N_Whorez	"Yup, and the sad part is that the Disney-Fox raised generations don't want to believe that Disney is a wealthy mind screw and huge drain on the economy. Anytime someone points out how the ""Magic Kingdom"" is so far from the illusion of ""The Greatest Place on Earth""... Well tears start rolling and the ""Not *My Disney*, oh no... They don't fleece the workers there and you can tell by all of the great movies they make for our kids and we grew up on from our childhood!"" 


""Say it ain't so Joe, say it ain't so!"" Lol, ""Screen Actors Guild? What's that?""..

The more Bernie gets attention when he speaks, the more I regain some hope for the future!"	5
SandersForPresident	tovversh	"I'm sorry, but he is right.  As much as you are right that this is an important fight, we need to be mindful of the fact that we need to win supporters to our cause, not enemies, especially within Democratic ranks.  If we go scorched earth on Democratic candidates, their supporters will never come around to supporting Bernie.  We need to be hitting people with how Bernie is so much better than all the alternatives, not trying to cast the other Democrats as worse than or as bad a Trump.  Even if you do honestly believe that, all that strategy will accomplish is guaranteeing that Bernie will lose.    
That doesn't mean we don't bring up Biden's failings, but keep it to the issues, and the damage the policies he's pushed have done.  Keep the name calling to a minimum.  Aside from the hard core supporters most people aren't that informed about politics, you'll get far more people to listen to you if you don't come across as a fanatic.  

The ideas that Bernie is pushing for are still considered radical in American circles.  We need to project level headedness to counter that.  Bernie knows that, and that's why he's setting this tone.  Learn from his example.  

We are in this for the long haul.  We need to be making friends and setting ourselves up to be on the winning side when the field starts to winnow.  Polls have shown that Bernie is the top second choice for most of the candidates in the race.  Don't going poisoning that well.  Yes it's better to get folks onboard now, but we don't want them to become disgusted with us by trying to demonize people they respect.  We need those people to win the nomination and we'll need them to beat Trump."	14

SandersForPresident	JustBombEm	"I see some of these states flipping earlier than others.

I’d say Sanders would hold everything Clinton won with the addition of the mid-west states she lost, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, also winning back Maine’s lone electoral vote. I think Florida, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and Missouri would be  the battlegrounds beyond those states, maybe Alaska too given its tendency towards outlandish candidates like Sanders.

I suppose the good news is that Biden was also trending flat before this 6-point announcement bump (the same that Bernie got). He started at 31% on Jan. 13 and was at 30% on April 21 before the 6-point bump.

SandersForPresident	Liquor_N_Whorez	"Ya know, out of about 30 people I know here in the rural sticks where ""Trump is good"" in the communities eyes. Only about 5 of them actually are aware and backed Bernie in 2016. Our County and State parks were shutdown in 2015 from 'flyash' contamination from the Dyna Corp coal fired plant illegaly dumping there and finally getting through to the EPA and court systems to legislate some fines and fixes here in 2018 after 30 years of fighting against Dyna Corp. The media finally gave a little attention to the issues. After the Media was silent for the most part on the issues over the last 30 years because they are ""sponsored in part by DynaCorp"".

Then, due to the shitty water quality and the actual trash dumps supporting the local economy from taking in Chicago's refuse that helps add to the contamination of the aquifer. (The largest aquifer in the State where a dump known to have dumped radioactive and toxic waste back in the 1990's and was caught doing it and still is operating even though it sits smack dab in the center of the aquifer.) Guess what?

The Cancer levels are through the roof here now. Where family farms once stood are just the foundations of remnants past. Economic desparity is the king here and people are leaving as soon as they can if they can afford to. Oh, and the new mass meat farms that help feed the entire Country. Well those animals are raised on the Corn and Soy feed grown by that water supply, as well as drink it when as they are raised here.

It's become a welfare trap, period.  Now the big news in the County is excitement of jobs getting created because a new coal mining operation has been accepted to open up shop here in 2020. We already have windfarms as far as they eye can see here. (But all the wind energy generated is said to go to bigger Cities like Chicagoland).

We also have bridges and roads that have fallen into such disrepair that the costs of fixing them with the systems ""prevailing wages costs, and Union Contracts"" can't be met so the easy solution is to close off the roads. 

Still, my neighbors think that AOC is a ""dumb communist bitch"", Bernie is a ""Socialist Nutjob Jew"", and trying to convince them that they both want to make a change to benefit everyone just leaves them blaming the ""Democrats"". They truly believe that Trump is going to make the changes needed. It's very, very disheartening because they are so brainwashed by the Fox media outlets. Fox has a pact with the Heartland Radio group who owns iirc 90% of all FM/AM radio stations. So it doesn't really matter which station they listen to or watch at work they are spoonfed all this anti- Bernie, anti- AOC bullshit. 

I even had an ex- friend tell me that oil isn't made from fossil fuels and that plastics aren't made from the byproducts of the oil industry. Yeah, they believe in the obsoletion of goods so much that Fox, and Msnbc and pals has sold them over the last 70 years that they actually think more Coal mines are a good thing. 

Blows my mind when I try to show them the other side of the fence. They just won't read it and won't accept that they have been had. On the topic of insurance and a socialised medical system all they have to say is ,"" I don't want my money going to lazy people who don't want to work for healthcare!"" Even though they will turn right back around and complain that half of their monthly income is now getting used to pay their own insurance bills. Those Insurance Companies don't usually even cover Dental or Optical needs. So they get pissed off when a pair of glasses is $700 and a Cavity costs $300 out of pocket. They get sick and need medical treatment that's supposed to be covered by insurance like Breast or Testicular Cancers.. Well the Insurance only covers so much of the treatments so they find themselves into their 401k if they have one. Paying ridiculous penalties to stay alive. Yet still the answers are ""We need a Wall!"", ""We need the jobs and shit wages created by the Corporations!"", ""We need WalMarts low, low prices to live!""....

It's disgusting to say the least, but I won't give up. I've lost a lot of people I considered friends over the years by getting into political discussions. Even have had it go so far to have ""Communist Faggot"" spray painted on my fence for speaking my mind.

EDIT: K, I figured it out between my time in between this edit. He isn't exactly correct, as you might have guessed. Here's my response:

He didn't say university. He said college. And he said public college, so let's look like at the lowest price. Now yeah, you have to switch to uni after 2 year for this but that's what most blue-collars do. I looked at the data for 2 year college in that same year.  About 300 bucks for each year of a 2 year public college tuition. For the other 2 years of your tuition in a 4 year it's 600 per year. So 306 hours at 2.10 an hour is about $650. To your credit, it is absolutely off by 4x the amount, but I believe that he could have meant 306 hours pear year not per four year. I mean definitely not defending such an error in Bernie's behalf, but I would say you could use some free college if you are that confident on this math. I am a pretty big Bernie supporter, but I mean this isn't exactly accurate to say the least. And just because I am a Bernie supporter doesn't mean I don't see the error in this tweet, nor does it mean my math is wrong and falsified by default. 


Tldr: 

2.10 x 306 = 642.60 per year income

2 year public college tuition only = $277 / year

4 year public college tuition only = $ 599 / year
 
Total 4 year public college tuition cost = $1752

4 years of income = $2570. 40

I think many became nonvoters because so many politicians are beholden to big pharma and oil and gas companies. I have never seen corruption like what I’ve seen in WV, and it’s not the people that are the problem it’s the corporatists. They don’t listen to average Americans.

Pregnant women are hurting themselves trying to work due to cuts in their leave. Understaffing by hospital administration put patient and the staff at risk of serious injury, all for a big bonus for the executives.

Little is talked of pathogen exposure risk. How is it healthcare workers put themselves in a cesspool of deadly pathogens every day, and not at least compensated for that? 

I truly believe that since nursing is a female dominated profession, and has a large amount of POC in recent years, it gets less attention for these issues. 

Friends, if you want to know the truth about healthcare, listen to the nurses. Look at all of this they put up with for the higher purpose of healing. They genuinely care about your wellbeing and they are the only ones in healthcare that are your real advocate.  Nurses want M4A, so what does that mean?"	-3

There is no do-over for this election - we either win and start making radical changes, or we accept that our failure contributed to an additional tens of millions of humans suffering premature deaths, and that's *if* our Democracy even survives this dumpster fire.  For whatever the failings of neoliberalism, none of the candidates on the Democratic side are undermining climate policy, and many [support the Green New Deal](https://www.axios.com/2020-presidential-candidates-green-new-deal-22faff60-3fee-45f3-8636-09e437c82431.html).

Donald Trump is a phenomenon.  Trying to beat him with another classical politician- the kind who will lie through their teeth to win a vote- is a fools errand.  Bernie Sanders cannot be bought. His loyalty is to the American people, not corporate donors.  He has been consistent throughout his career, always one step ahead of the pack.  When he got screwed over in 2016, he didn't complain about it for 4 years, he did his job as a Senator and waited for his next shot.   

This time around the American people have an opportunity to elect a real leader.  I just hope enough of them can see what's really going on."	6

SandersForPresident	YumYumPickleBird	"The AMA has good reason to be bothered by the chiropractors. Not threatened, but it is a serious concern, as chiropractors do not undergo comparable training and there is a standard of practice based on extensive research that makes medical guidelines. Chiropractors also follow naturopath models which are very dangerous at times. Issues with dislocation or anything involving the hip is a serious concern, I would always go to an orthopedist for that. I would say chiropractor can be good for physical therapy and they do have a lots of really good tricks to decrease pain and assist healing.

I completely agree on nurse practitioners and PAs. They are amazing and bring a measurably positive approach to care."	12

SandersForPresident	TAKEitTOrCIRCLEJERK	"> Is it okay when private platforms repress people?

literally putting people in cages is not in the same universe as banning white nationalism on a private video uploading platform. 

>I obviously agree but doesn't that contradict with all your previous arguments about private companies basically getting to do whatever they want?

no. White nationalists are not a protected class. We are allowed to discriminate against white nationalists and that is a good and righteous thing to do. 

>This is why I would simply say that I don't support freedom of speech in all cases rather than trying to rationalize censorship by private companies as somehow not a free speech issue whenever it's politically convenient.

it's not rationalization. It's the way that america works and has always worked and will always work. 

White nationalists were not welcome in the mall in Sandusky. They're also not welcome on Facebook. Simple.

>I think it's apparent that I was using the word ""monopoly"" in the commonspeech sense, not the technical definition of US law. I'm saying that there aren't serious alternatives to YouTube and so they're subject to higher ethical scrutiny.

but they're literally not a monopoly and there are dozens of other places where white nationalists can go upload their hateful videos."	16

Kamala Harris has had [212,000 total](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/us/politics/kamala-harris-fundraising-2020.html) ""contributions"" (not individual donors).  Kirsten Gillibrand, the only candidate with more than 50% of their \>$200 donations coming from women (because that apparently mattered to Rachel's point) *doesn't even have [enough total donors](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/2020-democratic-debates-which-candidates-have-qualified.html) to qualify for the debates yet* (Edit: She does qualify under the ""appears on enough polls"" rule, however).

SandersForPresident	thatduderman	lol, you need to learn what marginal tax means	0
SandersForPresident	Mags20XX	"Again, users of YouTube's platform **do not enjoy freedom of speech in any imaginable conception of the term**.  YouTube is a **private** platform.  That platform is **owned by Google**.  Therefore, it is ***wholly*** Google's speech being exercised.  You and I, as users, have absolutely zero **rights** to say or do anything on or with Google's software platforms.

And when we talk about ""freedom of speech"" that's what we're talking about .. we're talking about ""rights.""  Rights by definition are protections against action.  In this context, *you have* ***NO*** *right or protection against a* ***private party*** *doing as they will with their* ***private venue*** *since* ***you have absolutely no right whatsoever over the \*property\* being used***.

In essence, your argument suggests I can go to my neighbor's daughter's birthday party and start loudly telling people about my favorite pornographic films.  I'm outside, in the lawn, speaking to a group of people - why am I not protected by freedom of speech?  

I would be if I was on the curb, right?  (right!)

But not if I step on my neighbor's lawn though? (right! Once you step foot on his lawn, he has every right to remove you *including upon the basis of finding what you have to say to be objectionable.*)

**So simply put: the concept of freedom of speech does not extend or apply to instances between private parties where one owns the venue the other wishes to use.  In such case's it's the venue owner who has the right to exercise their speech and they are the sole arbiter of what gets expressed.  Not anyone else.**

>I don't see why Google's freedom to block the speech of others should obviously outweigh the freedom of speech of YouTube users.

Because YouTube users' freedom of speech **does not exist when extending the concept to YouTube**.  Only Google has freedom of speech on YouTube since they own the venue.

The size of Google in this case is frankly irrelevant, as is however impersonal one might find their corporation to be as a user of their services.  All the **rights** being discussed in this conversation belong to them - legally ***and ethically***.

>Is your position that all private censorship should be immune from criticism?

Let me be clear, I'm not talking about anything or anyone being immune from criticism.  

I am talking about freedom of speech, rights, and ethics.  I think Google has every right to censor their platform and you have every right to publicly criticize them for doing so.  ***That*** is freedom of speech.

But you cannot rationally assert that you also have a right to use their platform if they do not wish you to do so.  You don't own it, so how on Earth do you have a right to use it?  You also can't assert they must be forced to allow speech they find objectionable on their own platform.

>Relatedly, how do you feel about [free speech cages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_speech_zone)? They seem to be fully consistent with your conception of freedom of speech.

I'm wholly opposed.  

Again, this is why I said there seems to be a misunderstanding here.  

My position hasn't anything to do with restrictions on freedom of speech.  As I said, I'm against such restrictions virtually without exception.  But this concept gets muddied with the idea that individuals have rights over private platforms.... That position simply does not make sense.  And it's a position that has no moral, historical or legal foundation."	25
SandersForPresident	Mags20XX	"Based on the last sentence of your post, I think there is a fundamental disconnect here.  Again, I am not talking about government action here at all.  But I'll get back to that at the end.

For now, let me go through these points by first saying I understand the difference between legality and ethics - and that I'm arguing both simultaneously.  I am arguing that there is no self-consistent and widely held ethical framework by which someone has the right to someone else's venue for their speech.  No such right exists, and never has. 

You seem to acknowledge as much when you say the following:

>The two aren't comparable. Large impersonal service providers aren't going to be mistaken for endorsing all of the content they host and unlike a restaurant, there aren't any alternatives to FaceBook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.

Think about what you're saying.  You're using an arbitrarily defined, ad hoc  threshold where you get to decide which private entity enjoys freedom of speech and which doesn't.  Again, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Google - these are private corporations, are they not?  They enjoy just as much right to speech as any other company (like a restaurant).  

So this notion of ""smallness"" vs ""largeness"" and ""(im)personal services"" being necessary to have freedom of speech seems like an ad hoc / arbitrarily defined set of parameters, tuned to fit this particular argument.  

But nonetheless, it seems that you agree the restaurant owner has every right to kick out the Nazi, and he's not violating anyone's ""freedom"" by doing so; instead, he's exercising his own.  The Nazi's right to speak ends at his front-door, and begins on the curb; it doesn't continue into his dining room, right? 

This has nothing to do with the size and scope of the owner's establishment.   We could be talking about a mom and pop restaurant, just as we could be talking about McDonald's.  **They both have the exact same rights**; both legally and *morally*.

>How does kicking someone off of YouTube not curtail their ability to speak to their audience???

Rephrasing it this way avoids the actual question.  

To put this concisely: Google kicking someone off of YouTube curtails that person's ability to use **Google** to speak to their audience; yes.  But **no one has the** ***right*** **to use Google**.  

Think about it. 

Google is a software platform, a product - you do not have a RIGHT to use it, not morally or legally.  It's wholly-owned by it's shareholders operating as a private corporation.  The ethical rights are theirs, not yours or anyone else's.

So the person's rights are in no way whatsoever curtailed; they simply don't have access to a specific private platform in which the owner of said platform doesn't want to share or provide it for them.  

And no more can the Nazi argue, ""my rights are being violated"" because business don't want to hold their rallies than can anyone reasonably argue that Google is violating anyone's rights by taking down what they find to be objectionable content.

>Mandating or pressuring Google not to block a group of people does affect Google's freedom of speech, which is why I asked what the compelling interest of Google's speech is here since we have to weight it against the freedom of speech of YouTube users. 

Well these are two different concepts, right? Mandating vs pressuring.

If you're talking about a government *mandate*, that would require Google either being nationalized, losing their own First Amendment protections, or .. somehow .. expanding the definition of public utility to fit SaaS platforms like Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter -- but that would be a pretty extreme thing to do (since that would likely include all sorts of businesses).  I'm opposed to *all* of this, since it violates the rights of the property holder with apparently no good reason.  Furthermore, the FCC already has censorship laws on the books - so if you go down this road, you end up worse off than you started.

But from a property rights as well as a freedom of speech aspect, in effect, you'd be violating numerous aspects of the shareholders rights to benefit an amorphous group of trolls that want to abuse their platform (abuse as defined by the owners).   Again, not just legally but *ethically* \- this would amount to a violation of Google's rights.

Now, by contrast, **""Pressure"" from society, outside of government action, is totally fine**.  If consumers want Google to allow racist content or whatever, then they should make their voices heard. .  

Lastly, you keep saying that people posting on YouTube have, matter of factly, a *""freedom of speech""* to post on YouTube.  But that is the point of contention.  I'm arguing that they don't have such freedom, they never have, and that the very concept of what you're describing is not only unreasonable, but self-contradictory."	15

SandersForPresident	Vwar	"> ) Sanders supporters are generally left-wing. 

As am I, more so than Bernie in fact.   I'm a hardcore anti-capitalist.   The reason I oppose feminism (or many dominant strains of feminism) is because I support gender egalitarianism, not because I oppose it.   

>The Kibbutzim are organized around traditional Jewish principles.

False.   One of the central goals of the Kibbutz was to eliminate ""female oppression"" and ""traditional gender roles.""    Traditional marriage was replaced by communal living arrangements.   Women were encouraged to work in the fields and perform traditional male tasks.   In 1975, anthropologists Melford and Audrey Spiro returned to observe that the Kibbutz had become one of the most traditionalist societies in the world, turning the original model outside down.    ‘In the one place where feminists thought their ideal existed, the feminine mystique is ripening as fast as the corn in the fields’ (New York Times, April 1976).

And indeed we find the same in the Scandinavian nations.   The more choice women have, they less likely they are to pursue eg construction and engineering.   Conversely in countries where women have an extremely low amount of choice (eg China, one of the few countries where the female suicide rate is higher than the male) we find a very higher percentage of female engineers.  

There's a fascinating documentary on this called the ""gender equality paradox.""  

>Women weren't even allowed to work outside of the home (other than women being domestics) until the early 1960s.

Wow.   And you accuse *me* of being ignorant of history.  

Here's a [link](https://old.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/8v9e7s/feminist_myth_women_werent_allowed_to_work/) containing dozens of sources debunking this claim. 

>All false. Boys aren't oppressed or discriminated against in school (you provided no sources)

""Boys left to fail at school because attempts to help them earn wrath of feminists, says ex-Ucas chief.

""Britain’s education system is failing to tackle the “astonishing” underperformance of boys as feminists have made the topic “taboo”, the former head of the university admissions service has warned.
Mary Curnock Cook, who was chief executive of Ucas until last year, said the fact that boys are falling behind in education is a national scandal – yet it is such an “unfashionable” topic to discuss that it has become “normalised”.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2018/11/16/boys-left-fail-school-attempts-help-earn-wrath-feminists-says/

You're probably gonna want to drop this one, as I can provide you with literally hundreds of studies on discrimination against boys in the education system.  

>2) This is not oppression of men. There is no law on the books stopped men from seeking custody. Men get partial custody 80% of the time when they pursue it.

This is a common feminist myth.   In fact, only men who can afford good lawyers even bother attempting to seek custody, because they are told flat out that their chances are slight.   Even those who do challenge for custody often only get eg weekend visitation.  

There is any easy way of solving this issue.   Make joint custody the default position.  If one of the parents wants to relinquish parental rights they can do so.  All studies show shared parenting to be in the best interests of all concerned, most notably the children.   Feminists have successfully blocked shared parenting bills in dozens of states and countries.   This amounts to mass child abuse.   

>Boys are beaten slightly more often but molested less.

Boys are twice as likely to be murdered and much more likely to be abused in general.   Girls are slightly more likely to be molested, boys more likely to be raped.   

This is apparently of no concern to feminists, even though multiple studies have found that between 60 and 80 percent of male rapists were sexually abused by women as children.   They continue to pretend as though domestic violence is something men do to women and children, even though women are more likely to initiate unilateral violence against their partners, more likely to be engage in extreme controlling behavior, and more likely to abuse children.

>I'm a man.

Irrelevent.   As noted, it is actually common for men to have out-group bias toward the opposite sex.   This is why eg the mostly male heads of JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs fund feminist initiatives, while MRA's and real egalitarians are maligned by both the left and right and receive no state support.  So much for ""patriarchy"" lol.  

>Oppression comes from groups in power. 

Interesting.   So a homeless man is ""in power"" because Donald Trump has a penis.  That's some brilliant logic right there.   

>All the study showed is that most women consider women to be less violent and threatening than men. Most men also agree that women are less threatening and less violent. This is because most violence is perpetrated by men.

False.   Men commit the most homicides.   However women are just as violent.   They are simply more likely to use relational aggression, proxy violence, and violence against children and the elderly.   And of course they are significantly less likely to be punished even when they do commit overt psychical violence.   

>Women are seen as less competent at controlling themselves and are seen as less physically threatening

For once we agree on something, this is indeed true.   But there are related benefits (that feminists happily exploit) to these stereotypes, eg being institutionally privileged in the criminal justice system and receiving more support when they are harmed etc.

> if someone goes into a restaurant and decide to have a Nazi rally, the proprietor has every right (and some would say is morally compelled) to expel that person from his/her establishment

The two aren't comparable. Large impersonal service providers aren't going to be mistaken for endorsing all of the content they host and unlike a restaurant, there aren't any alternatives to FaceBook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.

> My argument doesn't restrict anyone's speech; whereas your argument restricts Google's

How does kicking someone off of YouTube not curtail their ability to speak to their audience???

Mandating or pressuring Google not to block a group of people does affect Google's freedom of speech, which is why I asked what the compelling interest of Google's speech is here since we have to weight it against the freedom of speech of YouTube users. I don't see why Google's freedom to block the speech of others should obviously outweigh the freedom of speech of YouTube users.

> Don't you see how that's not a logically self-consistent ethical framework?

Yes, there are competing freedoms of speech here. You're just dodging out of dealing with the issue by declaring that certain speech isn't speech.

>  the argument that we see online (a lot) about ""freedom of speech"" as a value that somehow protects people from private censorship simply doesn't make sense

SandersForPresident	OneLegsTheSame	"Why does Bernie (and all democratic politicians) constantly quote the current number of uninsured when discussing universal healthcare?

The amount of uninsured TODAY pales in comparison to the amount of people who will EVER be uninsured, even for a day. Universal healthcare guarantees everybody that they will NEVER be without healthcare, not just that they will have healthcare today. I have a great job which provides great healthcare. Telling people like me about how many people are currently uninsured doesn’t resonate with as many people.

Now, if you make me think about the fact that shit happens: lose a job, death, disability, rising premiums I can’t afford.....and the possibility that one day, I too, could potentially find myself or my family without healthcare, that resonates.

SandersForPresident	Mags20XX	"But I'm not conflating the *value* of freedom of speech with anything; **it's** **Google's freedom of speech that's protected**; *not just legally, but* ***ethically***. And that's the entire point here.  This is demonstrable logically as I've done so in this thread through the restaurant/platforming thought experiment.  So the point here is that the ""freedom"" you're point to does not exist, it never has.

Again, briefly, if someone goes into a restaurant and decide to have a Nazi rally, the proprietor has every right (and some would say is morally compelled) to expel that person from his/her establishment.  No one would reasonably assert the Nazi had a right to freedom of speech or assembly in that person's establishment.  No one.  So this freedom that you're referring to simply doesn't exist because Google in this case is the proprietor.

>Why is the compelling free speech interest of letting giant faceless corporations deny others their free speech?

The rhetorical nature of your question is self-defeating, and self-contradictory.  Think about what you're saying.

The neo-Nazi user of Google's software platform has every right to use their systems to put forward their content - even against Google's wishes - even though Google owns the platform, the software, the servers, and .. it's Google's website?  Why?? How did the user gain some degree of ownership over this private software platform?

You see that *your argument here* ***denies Google it's freedom of speech***, right?

***My argument doesn't restrict anyone's speech***; whereas your argument restricts Google's (and any ad hoc ""giant faceless corporation""), while simultaneously asserting it is more free than one that wouldn't have any such restrictions.

Don't you see how that's not a logically self-consistent ethical framework?

Freedom of speech entails Google, a private company, and the owner of YouTube, to determine what content goes up on YouTube (or [Google.com](https://Google.com) for that matter).  You, I, the government - no one has the ability to restrict them of that right.  And if they say ""no porn"" then there's no porn allowed.  If they say no racism, then no racism is allowed - just as if they said ""today we celebrate the Klan"" then that's their prerogative as the site/software owner.

But that right doesn't transfer to their customers, i.e., you and I as users of their platform; no more than you or I somehow get the right to use a person's private restaurant (or other venue) as a platform for our political rallies if they choose not to host us.  It's their property - not ours.  It's their rights that are in play -- not ours.

If what I'm saying doesn't make sense, believe me I'm more than happy to discuss this with you and try to re-articulate what I'm saying here.  But logically, the argument that we see online (a lot) about ""freedom of speech"" as a value that somehow protects people from *private* censorship simply doesn't make sense in this context.

p.s.

There are limited exceptions to the restaurant owner's ability to determine how his/her venue will be used; i.e., the proprietor cannot violate the Civil Right Act by discriminating on the basis of protected class.  But other than that... they're protected by the First Amendment, among other things."	11

Shortage of doctors is a whole other issue and you are assuming that if there is a shortage that M4A will will exacerbate the issue because healthcare utilization will increase but studies have shown that is not the case.

SandersForPresident	mnbvcxz123	">Beto O’Rourke, for his part, has gone from endorsing Medicare for All to endorsing the misleadingly named **Medicare for America**, a public option policy borne of several years of research from the Center for American Progress. With his support, it has quickly become the most popular moderate plan du jour. It’s even being touted as a “pathway” to Medicare for All, even though it’s really just a fine-tuned, slightly more comprehensive version of what we already have: It would put more Americans on a Medicare program, but the rest would still be required to purchase health insurance, either through their employers or privately. The plan would also introduce more government regulation to health care giants that charge wildly inflated prices for services and medication. This might sound like an improvement, but in fact, a comparable system already exists, in the Republic of Ireland, where it’s created a crisis of care.

Glad the Irish are doing the grisly advance research on CAP's vicious plan to keep Americans dying."	2

SandersForPresident	KabobBrewster	The thing is people will usually vote for themselves and that's means money/work. Progress is good, but I think to much to fast can have negative effects. Like with Medicare for all, most adults don't want to support other adults. I personally think proposing Medicare for all children would be a far better place to start and then work your way to all. Pretty sure most people no matter their party would get behind this.	3

In either the case of doctors or dentists, the solution is not to preserve the existing arrangement where some people get healthcare and others don't. Obviously, what we need to do is expand and rearrange the system where needed to be able to treat the entire population.

Others here make the point that the existing system also has weird incentives that may cause artificial shortages. That's obviously something a more centrally managed payment system would have visibility into and give us the tools to correct."	-1

The unofficial site Feel the Bern points to a [bill](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/american-health-security-act-of-2013?inline=file) Sanders introduced into the Senate in 2013 as indicative of what he would do in the future. In 2013, the Sanders position was that:

Health funding is to be adjusted per each state to reflect differences in average labor and nonlabor costs that are necessary to provide services - S.601(c) (1a)

Payments by states to health care providers is to take into account, among other factors, the cost of reasonable compensation to health care practitioners, compensation level of the instition or facility's work force, the extent to which health care services sufficient to meeting the needs of the community are being provided and changes in the consumer price index and other indices - S.511(2)

Additional payments and other incentivies can be made to ensure provision of health care services in medically underserved areas, particularly in rural and inner-city areas - S.618

Increased funding for health care education, meaning lower medical education bills, taking into account higher funding needs for placing health professional students in clincial education programs in health professional shorting areas - S. 605 and S.702

&#x200B;

Also, lowering administration costs and addressing the costs of drugs removes too sources of frustration for American healthcare providers, who don't like the red tape of having to deal with bureaucracies of insurance companies to work out who is covered for what and don't like having to consider not just what is the best treatment, but the best treatment financially available to the patient. 

His 2013 bill is certainly indicative of what he has considered in the past and thus his capacity to consider these issues in the future."	21

SandersForPresident	Mags20XX	"It's not disingenuous in the slightest since I'm being exceptionally open, honest and clear in my argument.  Before suggesting I'm being dishonest, why not even consider the points I'm making in good faith?

1. YouTube is owned by Google.  Google's choice in content is an exercise in their freedom of speech - not yours.  Their size and scope is irrelevant since they are a private company and YouTube is a SaaS platform.  It's not a medium of exchange of service in the way a public utility (like a telephone line) might be considered.  So, and this is a critical but seemingly confusing point, that **it's Google's speech we're talking about here** \- not the users.  The content published on YouTube is done so *by* Google.  It might not *feel* that way to you as a user; but it *is* Google's servers, Google's website, and Google's software system.  Google the company is responsible for what goes on their website and it's their speech that's protected **not** the content-providers (see #2 because that might seem confusing).  
2. **No one is talking about** ***government*** **bans**.  A government ban on content would be a restriction on speech since it's not Google making the decision but instead an actual legal restriction.  We are instead talking about private companies using their own discretion to determine what content they want to permit on their platform.  That is indeed ""censorship"" but **that's not a restriction on the right to free speech.  These two concepts are** ***not*** **the same thing**.
3. If Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter become public utilities then FCC regulations would apply, meaning the government would have the legal right to censor content that didn't violate the *""broadcaster's""* (note: not the user's) right to freedom of speech.  Which would mean that Google would need to step out in front of any litigation or action by Congress or the FCC to regulate (read: censor) racist content and assert this content represented ***Google's speech***.  And what are the chances of that happening?  There's other huge implications here BTW (but that's a different argument)

.. Now, are Google and Twitter public utilities?  No.  Absolutely not.  They're software platforms.  But the only way the logic you're trying to assert works is if we assume/assert that they are (or that they're somehow extensions of the government); and if they are, even then the logic doesn't work because we'd need to treat them the same as broadcast television and the radio - both of which have been censored for **decades**.

**I say all of this as someone who believes,** ***without exception*****, that hate speech laws are violations of personal liberty and that White Nationalists have every right to speak.**  

But a LOT of people, particularly younger people who look at social media and popular web applications as almost inherent aspects of life that we somehow have a *right* to - and that begets this really bizarre yet also complete and total misunderstanding of how this all works.

**Simply put: You do not have a right to say** ***anything*** **on Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Google isn't the government** **and Google isn't a public utility**; Google isn't regulated in that sort of way, and no one is arguing that it should be.  (In fact, many of us want Google broken up).  Google has sole discretion on what goes up or what comes down on their platform, since they own the platform.  It's their property, and the rights to freedom of expression on that property belong to them.

So if Google takes down content, as a private company operating a private software system, **they have every right to do so**.  And do you know why?  ***Because of their First Amendment right to Freedom of Speech***."	-1

And you haven't listened then because he absolutely has mentioned the class war and where it is going. 

He's literally the only candidate appealing to mainly blue collar folks. Truck drivers, fast food workers, people who stand to lose their jobs literally within the next 10 years to a machine. You think that's not going to effect the class war? Less jobs, AND only a few rich fucks actually owning the machines that do all the work? He wants universal education, universal healthcare, he wants budget reform, legal weed, campaign finance reform (I should've put this first because this is huge to him). 

He IS Bernie. Just a younger, more comprehensive version of him. 

You need to listen to what folks are actually saying, friend, and not just what you read about them."	3

SandersForPresident	buttaholic	"All of the media outlets are owned by 6 massive media conglomerates (you would be surprised which networks and companies are all owned by the same conglomerates). 


You have outlets like MSNBC telling journalists (e.g. Ed Schultz) not to cover Bernie. 


These ""journalists"" and newscasters get paid absurd amounts of money. So people like Ed Schultz will leave these networks because they havr integrity. Many people will say anything for a lot of money. After a while, i think a certain environment begins to cultivate. I doubt all of these newscasters are like ""haha we are rich and we're fucking over the poor"" (although I dont doubt that they're smart enough to see whats happening). I feel like they may be living in a bit of a bubble, and on some level might actually believe the bullshit they talk about just because that's the viewpoint they're surrounded with at work or at their social events. 


I don't know. But they make a lot of money doing it!"	1
SandersForPresident	usmcmd52	"But he is though. His entire reasoning for doing this is an entire portion of the population is being left behind. That's his stated reason for his platform. 

And beyond that, you can look at his actions. His ""Democracy Dollars"" idea for example. He wants each and every American citizen to get 100 dollars every year that they can use for absolutely nothing else but donations in elections. 

He wants to do this because he has seen how effective that method of fundraising can be now, and by giving people the money to donate to whoever they want, he offsets Citizens United and breaks the hold the rich and big companies have over our process. 

Seriously, you can't spend that money on ANYTHING other than elections, and if you don't use it by a certain time it goes away. 

People have been averaging like 20 dollar donations both to Yang and Sanders. Imagine if that average was 100 dollars. That's an even playing field again, DESPITE the fact that Citizens United hasn't been overturned. 

It's this type of thinking that makes Yang my man. He knows exactly what is ailing us, both the systematic problems, and the corruption that has stopped us from dealing with them. And he is thinking of new ways to bypass that fucked process to help get things going again. 

I'm telling you, combine him with Bernie and you've got the tag team duo this country both needs and deserves right now."	5

It surprises me that the left leaning subset of the tinfoil hat crowd is big enough for her to stay on the air. 

I think she’s playing to an empty room, we should be much more concerned with the questionable figures and baseless smears originating from outlets like NPR, WaPo, or CNN - they *were* historically less biased and considered more trustworthy than Maddow or MSNBC in general."	-4

SandersForPresident	Person51389	"Well, he never transferred his email list to her, so why would he transfer money ?   I am pretty sure that did not happen.  He had leftover money that he just put towards this campaign.  (10 mil from his last senate canpaingn and I believe also from the last election...that's how he has over 30 mil now.  He never gave money to Hillary.).   Also they begged and I thibk demanded or complained or who knows what in trying to get him to turn over his email list, esp when negotiating the DNC platform.  Bernie never gave it to them.  

What he did do was endorse her, as he pledged to back whoever was the nominee.  Also in allowing him to run as a democrat I think he agreed to endorse however won...so for those saying he is not a Democrat"".. it pretty much shuts that up.  If he wasn't a democrat he would have ran independent.  He even endorsed her, even if he hated doing it.  That was the agreement fir them to let him run as a Democrat, sane this time.  They will let him run, but he has to endorse whoever wins, even if he were to lose.  So, he did.  He kept his word. 

He also kept his word with us and never gave the email list to anyone, and saved the money as well...and is now crushing it w the #1 most money and #1 largest support base.  He is highly likely to win..."	9

SandersForPresident	opusdaily	Superdelegates cannot vote in the first round of voting at the convention as of last year, and there are 700 of them out of 4700 total delegates. They are dramatically less important this time. Though if it is a close race they will probably go for Biden due to them being party officials and his history of support for the party.	4

SandersForPresident	getmesomecoffee	Yes and kinda no. We need to let people know how strong a canidate Bernie is.

SandersForPresident	DisarrayTheory	I believe Bernie has a better chance than Biden to beat Trump, despite what the media wants liberals to think. However, we all need to stand behind the Democratic nominee, whoever it is: Bernie, Biden, or anyone else. Trump and the GOP are ravaging our government and our country's standing in the world. The Democrats must regain control of the White House and maintain at least the House of Representatives, even if led by the elitist, corporate wing.	4

SandersForPresident	damrider	"Here we go again. We dont like a poll result, so lets analyze the shit out of it and find whatever reason to discredit the result we don't like instead of facing the reality as it is.

This sub is more hell bent on denying reality and claiming it's all a vast conspiracy against us then fighting to change it.

I know it was very fun to pretend we are the frontrunners for a month. But it wasn't true then and it's not true now. Accept reality, let's move forward and fight to change it. 

By the way that's not even that small a sample. Under 45 year olds are at best 40% of the electorate. So that implies a ~350 sample size overall which isn't great but isn't out of step with most polls, including Emerson who gives us good results."	6

They'll vote for or against the same bills depending on whether one of their team supported it or not.	5

I can keep linking links for you if you want, but the facts are that--just like literally every fucking election--there are plenty of polls that show things the other way. It's on you as a critical thinker to be able to interpret the accuracy.

From your Atlantic source - ""Then there’s where he stands in early polls, behind only Joe Biden. ""

From your Politico source - ""While most polls show the former vice president hovering around 30 percent of the Democratic primary vote, well ahead of second-place Sen. Bernie Sanders""

Your NY Post source is the ""one"" poll that I referenced earlier. 

Your USA Today source is literally referencing the same poll that NY Post is. You can't just double up on the same poll, one that I was referring to.

All you did was prove my point - you live in a bubble and only seek out sources that confirm the **SINGLE** poll that Bernie has lead in so far. ""Plenty"" of polls, my ass. It's one. Exactly one.

Anyway, go to [this](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html) page and scroll about 1/3 down. You can see alllllllll the polls in which Biden is beating Bernie in (read, virtually all of them. Like, seriously. 38 of them out of the top 40). Again, just because you don't want something to be true, does not mean it isn't true."	5

SandersForPresident	Rshackleford22	10 months away and name recognition. There hasn’t even been a debate. Just calm down and keep trucking. Don’t freak the fuck out. Biden will most likely fuck up in the debates. People associate him with Obama right now. And most voters don’t even want to pay attention to the primary cycle because it’s so long and drawn out.	-6

SandersForPresident	Person51389	If it's a punishment, it's like the weakest punishment ever.  I mean, you can say that, but I wouldn't really call it much of a punishment.   It would be like a crooked cop making his buddy return...some of the money they were taking.  (12%...). Is that a punishment ?  Not really.  They are still letting them take most of the money.  Its more reward than punishment.   Vs Bernie's plan which advocates that ZERO be taken, (and definitely not at 12%) and will actually impose multiple punishments (actual repurcussions) such as...no more federal projects, and like 5 other things.  In comparing which is a better, stronger, punishment, it's not even close, and 1 is so light so as to have no impact on the behavior (allowing them to keep doing the activity essentially the same as they were)...that I would not call it much of a punishment, no.  (Crooked cops...very tough on other crooked cops....).  Bernie's plan is 5,000 times better, and would actually be enough to potentially deter the behavior.	6
SandersForPresident	beamish007	Wrong. If the DNC wants to make the same mistake as 2016, then they are showing me that they want to lose to Trump. Maybe it will take 4 more years of Trump for people to wake up. I held my nose and voted for Clinton in 2016, but I knew in my heart that she was going to lose. I won't make the same mistake again and I know that there are a whole lot of people that feel the same way.	-3

I like ballot questions because they can be incentive to get people out to vote, but there is a point where people will naturally start checking off boxes when there are 20-30 questions to answer. 

It’s hard enough to have an informed opinion on a lot of the stuff on the ballot. 99% of voters read the pro and con argument and then form their answer based on emotion. Literally everything wrong with politics. At least if there are fewer questions more people will have the time to think about the questions and form opinions that way."	-2

The Red Cross provides aid to people injured from war regardless of their side. That isn't interference, but neutrality.

The_Donald	Skyrailmaxima	"For the most part you're repeating a lot of the argument I make,  I was explaining the authority of the federal government in borders. 

On the contrary you could make the point that people who enter our borders illegally are foreign agents acting with hostility due to the disregard for law.  Because of this and the perview of the federal government you could say using military and lethal force to deal with them is technically justified. This is because you could argue that a single misaction by one of them constitutes an act of war, as they are a foreign legion-by technical definition. 

If the constant drain becomes great enough it may be informal militias forming that do such a thing. And since no one wants that nightmare unfolding (for the most part) removing them or at least processing and recording should be seen as a nessesary step. In fact,  at the border this  is already starting, and with the divide in this country as it is this is where the eventual insolvency of our state will begin - where no law can be enforced."	0

1. What is Bill Maher?

Self-styled wannabe smart guys *hate* Trump.     Look at your academics, your professors of gender studies, right?  

2. 2020 hinges on red-pilling the centrists.  
Boring, I know, but this whole “Round ‘em all up & ship ‘em off to Gitmo” thing is actually not going to happen, of course.  

3. Bill Maher will never convince a common-sense patriot of his wacky leftist views, so who cares if he’s “controlled opposition?” (And I’m not totally convinced that he is)   

—   

Maher happens to go FULL, BALLS-OUT DIRECT OPPOSITION to 2 primary tenets of the left.  

1. Bill Maher will always insist, publicly, that Islam is a violent cult.  
2. Bill Maher will always shred the SJW regressive left.   

This is HUGE for us, because if we can disapprove one or two things, the centrist‘s TDS can be broken through just enough so they might start thinking for themselves.  

TL;DR  To those others who might insist that Bill Maher has no value to MAGA, that he’s just a tool, remember that tools might have uses.

The_Donald	sticky-bit	"I think it's a combination of cracking down on diverted Rx pill, and all the heroin from Afghanistan along with all the fentanyl from China. 

It's pretty much a perfect storm.

1. liberal Rx policy and diversion makes plenty of addicts
1. DEA several years ago cracks down on liberal Rx to drive up the price of diverted drugs. This does not magically make addicts quit for some reason that appears lost on the DEA drug warriors.
1. As the cost goes through the stratosphere, powder heroin looks more like a viable option (to addicts being squeezed, it still looks like an insane option to us.) Personally I'd rather have addicts popping cheap safe pills of a known dosage rather than shooting up in bathrooms and leaving thousands of dirty needles behind the Home Depot in Everett, WA; but that's just me.
1. Street heroin is cut with fentanyl and other synthetics. Fentanyl is powerful enough that it's near impossible to accurately dose by the bucket chemists. Other synthetic related chemicals are much worse. 
1. This results in wildly varying street doses of heroin, making it easy for people to overdose
1. The street price of diverted pharmaceuticals is so high that it made it worth it for drug cartels to counterfeit the Rx pills. 

Prince was found dead with counterfeit prescription hydrocodone pills stamped ""Watson 853"". I'm sure the majority of people who are found dead with prescription pills don't have the drugs tested, but Prince was famous. His counterfeit pills contained fentanyl and an even more powerful drug called  U-4770."	2

The_Donald	Specious_Lee	"Yeah, I meant Americans by 'your people.' But criticism of JP remains.  He gives excellent advice, good for for personal growth, much needed.  My criticism is he preaches an identify of individualism and rejects the notion of having a national identity, which is precisely what Marxism aims to destroy.  [https://imgur.com/NWQt4fG](https://imgur.com/NWQt4fG)  He's critical of post modernism but doesn't address how the individual should process it when encountering those forces.  Meanwhile society is collapsing at its hand.  He says ignore it go on with your life. He makes millions selling books telling people to get their shit together, which is a necessary first step, warns about the threat of a rising right wing but is silent on the forces at work bringing it about. 

He claims the most dangerous thing is if whites banded together to protect their interests but says little about the overt anti-white racism and obvious threat of the now ubiquitous in society narrative of 'whites as oppressors'.  The rise in white identity politics is a reaction to identity politics that intended to destroy white identity.

There is no reason why whites can't have a shared collective consciousness, Jordan's advice results in white people being scattered into a million pieces meanwhile minority group consciousness is promoted and all aggrieved groups are banning together to take down the 'oppressors.

""Historical perspectives"".  Just because something was practiced in history doesn't mean it should be accepted.  Then again, to be fair, this may be one of those things I'm mixing up; old civilizations (like Greece) had instances of older men bonding with teenaged boys, but I was under the impression that that had mostly to do with the history of homosexuality in societies....but, now that I think about it, maybe it's ""pederasty"", which is sexual relations between a man and a boy.

People turn to addiction because the things which normally give meaning and purpose have been shit on for decades.  Community, religion, the family unit, any semblance of belonging, all of this has turned to absolute dogshit.  The country is in massive decline and a general pessimism has taken hold of the people.  That's why so many people are fat, addicted to drugs, in debt, wasting away in front of a TV or jerking off to porn in their mom's basement.

The_Donald	DieHardOriginalist	"An important read from Publius Huldah· (Constitutional Lawyer and Scholar), Tuesday, October 30, 2018

BABIES DON'T PROVIDE ANCHORS!

Section 1 of the 14th Amendment says, in part:

“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside…”

One of the purposes of Section 1 was to extend citizenship to freed slaves.

This Section does not provide that illegals who invade our Country and drop a baby here are automatically the parents of a US citizen.

The key is “subject to the jurisdiction thereof”: Consider the French ambassador and his lovely young wife stationed in Washington, DC. She gives birth to a child here. Her child was born here. But is her child “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States? No! The child is subject to the same jurisdiction as his parents: France.

Consider the American Indians: Sec.1 of the 14th Amendment did NOT confer citizenship on American Indians. They were not “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States” – they were subject to the jurisdiction of their tribes.

An illegal alien who invades our Country is in the same status as the French Ambassador’s wife. The baby she drops here is “subject to the jurisdiction” of the Country she left.

So the 14th Amendment does NOT confer citizenship on babies of illegals born here – just as it does not confer citizenship on the babies of foreign diplomats stationed here.

Pursuant to Art. I, Sec. 8, clause 4, US Constitution, Congress may make laws deciding how people become naturalized citizens.

But Sec. 1 of the 14th Amendment does not confer citizenship status on babies born here of illegal aliens.

This is important."	-1

So the 14th Amendment does NOT confer citizenship on babies of illegals born here – just as it does not confer citizenship on the babies of foreign diplomats stationed here.

Pursuant to Art. I, Sec. 8, clause 4, US Constitution, Congress may make laws deciding how people become naturalized citizens.

But Sec. 1 of the 14th Amendment does not confer citizenship status on babies born here of illegal aliens.

Yes kids got molested in the past as they do today, but it wasn’t celebrated or normalized. It was considered degenerate and wrong. 


For example, you commonly hear fake historians cite the pederasty phenomenon in Ancient Greek cultures particularly in the military like people encouraged it or it was ok. It wasn’t. It was frowned upon and condemned. But yes it did happen. 


Rather pedohilia needs to be looked at for what it is. It’s extreme perversion that eventually snowballs to that state the same way a porn viewer starts out with soft core stuff then the next thing you know they’re watching a bunch of hulking black dudes who could be NFL linebackers going to town on some frail barely legal teenage girl.

Establish a long-term relationship with a single prescribing doctor who knows your medical history. Establish a long-term relationship with a competent pharmacist who also knows your medical history. Make sure the doctor and the pharmacist are on the same page about your medication plan. Make sure they know how to contact each other if the need arises. If you are the patient, volunteer for random drug screenings to monitor abuse. Notify all parties in advance about any dosage/scheduling changes.

Doctors and pharmacists have to shield themselves from liability like anyone else. But most are decent people who actually want to help patients in need. A little bit of honest, open communication can go a long way."	7

The_Donald	EnhancedEPC	"The ""civilizations in decline"" argument doesn't help.  It might even contribute to these degenerates position by distracting from the issue with a potentially false statement.

Pedophilia has been accepted by civilizations on the rise, at their zenith, and in decline.  There are also civilizations that have declined that haven't accepted pedophilia.

Its an intellectually lazy statement that creates an opportunity for people who support this disgusting shit to make a rational argument about the state of civilizations.

Instead of taking philosophical positions about civilizations its better to stick to the ""pedophilia is sick shit that harms children and pedophiles should be reviled"" argument.  This argument is much harder to argue against because its simple and true."	-8

Actually, it’s about time that a president looked at the specific needs of different demographic groups. That’s a good businessman and an effective president. Trump didn’t use identity and divide America with hatred, he exposed where it was coming from. America, the United States, is the only identity I want my president catering to first.	3

The_Donald	Kitten_Wizard	"I totally agree with you. I'm a chronic pain patient and so is my partner. We were lucky to find private doctors who would prescribe our medications but others aren't so lucky. Most medical groups now have a policy of no opioid medications regardless of the legitimate reason. It makes no sense when the doctors are so afraid of the DEA that they can't prescribe the only medication available for pain.

Surgery? You will have a hard enough time getting them to dispense opioids in a timely manner while you're there let alone leaving with a script.  Even though the surgeon knows you need pain medication during recovery they wont write any but will give a referral to your primary care doctor to deal with it. Do they expect the primary care doctor to see you that same day or are they just doing it pass the responsibility to someone else to deal with?

My partner is a veteran so he goes to the VA exclusively, EXCEPT for pain medication, because they *refuse* to write any pain medications at all now. He has *multiple* conditions that justify a prescription due to the significant intractable pain. One of the worst issues for him are his shoulders which cause severe pain just laying down. Obviously being in pain from laying down is a big issue when you have to lay down to sleep!

While staying in California my partner tried medical marijuana to see if it helped his issues and he says it helped a lot and he was able to modulate his opioid dosing because of it. Our home state has medical marijuana but because of the federal law, any controlled substance dispensing requires a drug test every doctors visit to get your script (every month!) so if you test positive for marijuana you get your script pulled and I believe you can be flagged in whatever monitoring system is used.

It's such a horrible state of affairs that pain patients are in and its only getting worse.

* Government is causing artificial shortages to curb diversion, 
* Doctors are more afraid of prescribing opioids and a DEA raid than the health of their patients
* Pharmacists purposefully under-ordering opioids so that they have no stock
* Legitimate pain patients are seen as drug seekers and it only gets worse when you have to go to several pharmacies every month looking for one with stock so you can get it filled.

Oh yea and big chains like Walmart and Walgreens are outright banning doctors and medical groups willy nilly. I guess the only good thing about that is it helps little mom+pop pharmacies but there's more of the issue with no stock."	-20

The_Donald	DillyKally	"I left a corporatist try to spend words and use rhetoric top escape the conversation

Nobody is telling the government to ""control speech""

that's a straw man argument created by corporatist Libertarians who don't want to ever see a rich person have to follow any laws

why Libertarians constantly Advocate against their own interests in favor of the interests of the ultra-rich? Who knows.

the bottom line is we need a basic regulation on the media. It wouldn't mean that the ""government controls the media"" (even though half of the government -Democrats- already do that)

It wouldn't be an ""attack on Free Speech"" (an attack on Free Speech would be something like what Faceboo does. Censoring opposition. Something that corporatists vehemently support Facebook's right to do. which is ironic that corporatists heavily opposed something done by the government while supporting the exact same thing if it's done by a private Corporation. Because at the end of the day corporatists care more about helping the rich than helping the country)

it wouldn't be the destruction of the free press. It wouldn't kill Free Speech. It wouldn't mean that the government specifically creates the news and tells the media what to report.

those are all strong and fake arguments. We're simply saying that the government reinstitute what it had and issue fines to Media Outlets caught purposely lie. Because that should not be supported

Now if you have an argument against that that doesn't rely on Straw Men and fallacies and doomsday predictions then feel free to State it.

but if the only thing you can claim is that the government would be in complete control of the media then you're just making up Straw Men."	16

The story is really good and the political intrigue and strategy is great because it’s more faithful to the spirit, traditions and cruelty of medieval times (even though this is fantasy). There are times where there is some gay stuff and some women power but I don’t think it’s preaching. A lot of medieval royalty was gay but married and fathered children for the lineage and I have no problem with empowered and strong women as long as they aren’t shoving a message down my throat. I also fee that they DGAF about portraying the midget and many women as physically incapable but still strong and useful personalities which is refreshing.

For instance, in 2004 Trump asked the bank’s commercial real-estate group to lend him more than $500 million to build his 92-story skyscraper in Chicago; it did, but not before employees concluded he was majorly inflating his net worth, and were told he’d “worked with people in the construction industry connected to organized crime.” Ten years later, when Trump was trying to buy the Buffalo Bills and needed to prove to the league he had the funds to pull off a transaction that could exceed $1 billion, the bank agreed to vouch that his worth was $8.7 billion, something his former fixer Michael Cohen told lawmakers was an (obvious, extreme) exaggeration back in February.

I’m the son of a former Citigroup employee which is a bank way larger than both of these two. If you think he has a chance in hell against Cap One (10th largest US bank) and Deutsche (15th largest worldwide), think again. He’s lucky it isn’t JPMC or BOA. Or even Citigroup."	6

That's like expecting us to bring a task force of people that are ready to grant asylum to every part of the border just in case people decide to cross there. We're not doing that. Use the gate or eat lead.	5

Lastly, if youre going to allow felons to vote, why not  extend every other right taken by the law. Why are they being kidnapped by the state when by this logic they should be allowed to be free and go to a gun store and buy guns.

Personally Id have deployed outriders to asses the direction the dead were coming from hours in advance and prepare my cavalry on the opposite side of the fortress. The wights dont seem to have much of a mind for tactics so I think theyd simply be distracted by the phalanx and then the cavalry could hit the flanks and relieve pressure on the phalanx when needed and when not fire arrows while moving."	-3

The_Donald	WatashiwaAlice	"Did we read the same article? The main part of the article mentioned a transgender woman, and that is a woman according to most definitions I've read - - and more importantly, in the article, it does use she and her pronouns, and reference them as a woman. That is why I did the same for the sake of clarity . Anyway,  this to my knowledge is not debated within the medical community, so in the context I'm speaking of, there was a woman in the article. 

Selectively not gendering specific transgender women  makes things confusing, and doesn't change the view--at least not by the American health associations I'm familiar with, so I also do not debate it. I am not a doctor, and I assume a doctor knows better than you or I. For the sake of clear communication, I follow the standards laid out by professionals, and was in fact responding directly to what I had read in the article linked above, which does mention a woman.... So did we read the same thing? 

Further, I don't have debate opinions on ""vanity"" surgery, although to my knowledge it is classified differently, and that is why the current health care system does, in fact, pay for transgender women or men to get sexual reassignment, or gender affirming surgeries covered under their insurance.


What do you think of breast surgery for transgender men? That is to say, removing the breast tissue.

Also, abortions, to my knowledge and from my perspective, is an issue fundamentally divorced from and with no overlap to transgender health care. Seems apples and oranges for this discussion. It's distracting and counter productive if the goal is to end abortion, because you're fighting two battles at once. You will confuse people."	2

The series starts strong and is very faithful to the books for a good while, but because the books are so sprawling and spread out, they are too much to distill down into a tv show, even at 10 episodes a season they had to start cutting things and changing the character arcs somewhat.

Like most adaptations, this is where things start to go amiss, and since this show got so popular, the showrunners started ""making it their way"" and they think they know better than the original author.

Combine this with George RR Martin never actually finishing the books, the show surpassed the point the book got to, and things start kind of wandering.off.

They should have to jump through hoops for it, the same as a legal alien would to obtain citizenship (citizenship test, tons of community service hours, military service, that sort of thing.).    

But to be fair, I also think that everyone should have to go through and pass a voters course to be able to vote.  That at the very least will eliminate people voting for things they don't understand.  Normally, this would have been done in primary school.  However, I don't think this (civics, government) is taught anymore.  

I also don't want everyone voting anyway.  Those that have no skin in the game, will keep screwing over the rest of the country in favor of a few extra welfare bucks in the pocket.  For example, if you are on welfare services for the calendar year, you should not be allowed to vote, as you are compromised and your vote can be bought.  Maybe this just applies to certain situations.  For example, if you don't own property, you should not be allowed to vote on whether or not the property tax in your area should be raised.

I will grant that these are unpopular opinions and would love to discuss them with anyone (civily)."	6

Unlike the living, the undead didn't break ranks when charged with cavalry; they swarmed.

The Unsullied died as they were soldiers; they protected the retreat, they had to protect the retreat as no other army would follow that order.

The Dothraki and Unsullied were immigrants; the Dothraki died as the bravest men in the world, willing to charge at hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of undead; while the Unsullied were heroes that willingly stood in front of the final defense to sliw down the incoming horde.

Game of Thrones didn't just kill off immigrants; it made the immigrants the best among us, as when the Night King came it was those from Essos that stood their ground.

The Wildlings were likewise immigrants; and the wildlings stood between the castle and the fire as the Knights of the Vale ran to cover behind the walls.

There's plenty more Dothraki in the South; the screamers came over because they were promised conquest, not to immigrate; and the rest of the Dothraki aren't willing to cross the sea because something something horses.

Let's also take a minute to appreciate how bad the episode was, beyond the ""zombies are everywhere and everyone dies"" factor:

- The Dothraki screamers, light cavalry, used for a frontal charge as if they were heavy cavalry. Unless they really wanted to find a glorious death in their suicidal charge, they were thrown away and wasted.

- Catapults, the precious only artillery option that they had, deployed on the field, ahead of the infantry, and don't start shooting until the cavalry charged. 

- Infantry deployed outside of the walls, good grief WHY. What did they accomplish is anyone's guess.

- Trenches that took forever to get lit.

- Dragons that did very little and when they did do something, it was inefficient. I.e. when the zombies stopped at the lit trenches, why didn't the dragons start burning them from the front rather than flying around far in the back and putting on a light show? 

- By the way, is this 2019 or 1999? The green-screen effects that were employed when they showed Jon and Dani flying were HORRIBLE.

- Also with all the mid-air maneuvering, how did they stay attached to the dragons without any kind of harness?

- Oh yeah, remember how the lit trenches stopped the zombies? Catapults on the walls would have been AMAZING at that moment, and so would be some archers. Hello, stationary targets on full display, fucking DO SOMETHING. 

- Bran did exactly fuck-all other than sit in a chair and flying some birds around. Why did the Night King need to kill him anyway?

- Jon robbed of any kind of glory: no epic duel with the Night King, no slaying the undead dragon... nothing.

- Night King got Snoked. That is all.

- But, hey, stronk whamen. Stronk whamen showed them all how it's done. Now we're all set for the final contest between evil stronk whamen and good stronk whamen. We waited 8 years for this shit. Such progressive, much woke, very feminism, WOW."	-12

The_Donald	DrMonsi	"care to explain why?  I know I'll probably get some downvotes, but let me still explain: 

For context, I'm Swiss. As far as I'm aware, you can vote whilst being in prison here. (I tried to look it up. I found no definitive statement saying that you can vote whilst being in prison, but the only mentioned thing i found that can exclude you from taking part in elections / votes is having a legal guardian)

I have no particularly strong opinion on it, but I cannot see why you should loose your right to vote for being in prison, except maybe if you serve a life sentence, or maybe if you serve some time for treason or voter fraud or other political charges thelike.

But, if we assume that your stay in prison is only temporary, you are still a citizen of the country, and you should still be able to cast your vote. You will be free at one time in the future, and I fail to see why you should not be allowed to influence the political future of your country just because you're in prison for some drug crime or drunkenly causing a road accident or something. 

the right to vote in my opinion is one of the most fundamental rights any citizen of a country can have. There's maybe a difference in culture between Switzerland and the USA here, as we can vote on a lot more issues than you guys can... 

We can usually vote on about 15 to 20 policy changes throughout a year, and an election every two years. (the cantonal parliament and the state parliament every 4 years) 

I understand that there are problems with the voting system in the US, but in my opinion, letting prisoners vote is not the biggest issue. 

If you ask me, you should begin with voter ID, and making sure every citizen can only vote once, and not just travel from voting booth to voting booth. We have this in Switzerland since forever, basically, and it's universally accepted. You get a letter with an official ""voting card"" along with the ballot papers, and you can only cast your ballot papers in your home city, along with your signed voting card (in a different urn). The voting card only works in your home city, and the people at the ballot are checking it. 

I'm aware that many of you guys here probably have this opinion because changing it would benefit the democrats, and that's a valid point. 

I just don't see any valid argument why you should, on principle, not be allowed to vote whilst being (temporary) imprisoned. 

If you have a democracy that says ""every citizen of our country can vote"", then exceptions to this rule should be very, very rare, even if you personally don't like certain people. Yes, I do think that even pedophiles should be able to vote. Just because they're pedophiles doesn't mean they can't have a valid political opinion, which they should be able to state, assuming they are legal citizens.

As said, I'm willing to make exceptions for life sentences, as this basically means that you are not part of society anymore."	-20

*President Taft and Porfirio Díaz planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Both sides agreed that the disputed Chamizal strip connecting El Paso to Ciudad Juárez would be considered neutral territory with no flags present during the summit, but the meeting focused attention on this territory and resulted in assassination threats and other serious security concerns. The Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. An additional 250-person private security detail led by Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was hired by John Hays Hammond, a close friend of Taft from Yale and a former candidate for U.S. Vice-President in 1908 who, along with his business partner Burnham, held considerable mining interests in Mexico.*

*On October 16th, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured and disarmed the would be assassin within only a few feet of Taft and Díaz.*"	1

The_Donald	Ghostof_PatrickHenry	"Yes, except this assumes that there would have been a position for the Dothraki horde to ""hide"" until the undead reached the unsullied. (There wasn't). They had earthwork trenches dug in front of the castle, with the Unsullied in the vanguard, with a mixed group of Wildlings and  armored Westerosi on either flank. (The less armored peasants were at the rear of the flanks, near the earthworks.) 

If you look at the scene where the Red Witch ignites the Dothraki blades, you can see just how much space the horde requires. (Basically, the entire vanguard, and some of the right flank.) This makes complete sense, since a single Dothraki mount would take up as much space as at least 3 Unsullied-- who are also in much tighter formation. 

If you look at the great battles of history, the strategy you are calling for (and makes complete sense) requires an ""off-site"" staging area that is out of view, for the calvary unit to wait for the attack to begin. There was no such space, due to the earthworks, and the danger of placing ground units off in the dark somewhere remote where they could be overrun by the dead. (They had no idea where or how the dead would attack. Only the direction from which they were coming.) 

The only worse way to utilize light calvary than as shock troops is to use them as defensive units. (Dothraki do not do defense- hence the lack of armor and defensive structures found in their homeland.) Dothraki only attack-- offensively-- and they are extremely effective, as we saw in their battle against the Lannisters. (Imagine if the Dothraki just stood there on their horses, waiting for the undead to charge.) 

The truth is that the Dothraki probably would have been more effective in the battle if they had dismounted and fought as infantry. On horseback, they made themselves easy individual targets for the undead to swarm. (Plus, the psychology effects the undead would have on the horses.) But you try telling the Dothraki that they aren't going to fight on horseback, or that they aren't allowed to fight in the way they are most comfortable (charging on horseback.)

Spez: The ""strategy""-- according to the producers in the behind the scenes clip-- was to create concentric circles of defense, in order to delay the dead reaching the center of Winterfell. The idea being to force the Night King to land in the Godswood to kill Bran during the battle (rather than after). So the purpose of the Dothraki attack was to establish a perimeter out  away from the defenses, and delay the engagement of the infantry-- to prolong their lifespans-- and goad the Night King into exposing himself to Dany and Jon. (Nobody would have guessed how ineffective the Dothraki horse would have been--including the audience. My wife says it is her favorite part of the entire episode, because it is so encouraging and then so defeating, making it scary as fuck. So, from a movie-making standpoint, well done.)"	-23

Hacking a computer or engaging in copyright infringement can already be a felony. And I'm not convinced that this should disqualify you from voting. Also, in many countries, racism / hate-speech can be a felony. Wouldn't it be very convenient for the Left to deny voting rights to everyone they consider a racist? I don't care about a few murderers voting. But I'm afraid a hostile government could easily abuse a rule that denies certain people the right to vote.	-10

The statute has been used by Congress before and was used in a high-profile case when Congress investigated whether the IRS was discriminating against conservative groups applying for non-profit status.

Black hispanics are just considered black so why aren't white hispanics just considered white? It is because dems have driven a wedge in to cause division. By the 3rd and 4th generation most hispanic americans just think of themselves as white, show no signs of hispanic culture, and generally marry whites. This can even be seen at a lesser extent with the 2nd generation. I think that this is something that will become a much bigger topic moving forward as the hispanic population increases.	1

If a state has a $500 minimum felony limit for theft,  someone steals a bike worth $400 that’s a misdemeanor and can vote, but someone else steals a $500 bike and that’s a felony and they lost their voting rights.

I agree that there is a general, gradual change over time of how people think, what they value, etc.   But setting a hard line is just plain silly.

The ""Millennial"" label is just branding a noticeable trend of mindsets and values of people of a certain age.  And I think it is generally valid to observe those trends.  However, anyone that falls into that Millennial birth year range certainly can **try** to behave more like someone that was born in 1925 and lived through the Great Depression and WWII if they want to.  They certainly would stand out among their peers if they did so successfully!

The_Donald	JDMGuy1992	"And you believe the “I’m still under audit” bullshit? Being under audit doesn’t stop someone from releasing tax returns. You *are* aware of this, correct? I’m just making sure. 

Trump's full tax returns would reveal how much he donates to charity, what tax rate he pays, whether he pays federal taxes at all, and whether he receives income from foreign sources that could create conflicts of interest. They would shed light on whether his net worth is as high as he claims. And I think that’s why he doesn’t want them released at all. He doesn’t want to be embarrassed and quite frankly, that’s somewhat understandable. 

But, in 2018, The New York Times report also revealed a massive and long-running effort by the whole Trump family to evade taxes through corporate shell companies and the like. Another story that dug up his 1995 tax returns showed Trump deducted a near-billion dollar loss, potentially allowing him to pay nothing in taxes for almost the next 20 years. 

The last possibility is that Trump's tax records would provide investigators with substantial evidence of outright fraud.

Late last year, ProPublica co-published an investigation with WNYC into the Trump Organization's international deals. They found many of the projects bore evidence of deception. Writing in The New Yorker, Adam Davidson summed up how the business realm of real estate can be fertile ground for various schemes: You can inflate both the money you yourself have poured into the project, as well as the number of buyers you already have ready to go for the units. That exaggerates the market value of the project, leading other investors to pile on. When the project goes belly up, you walk away unscathed because you were paid upfront and throughout the project. The other investors are left holding the bag. 

""The Trumps repeatedly lied about these two factors,"" Davidson wrote, ""telling potential investors that far more units had been sold than really were and saying that they had invested much of their own money in the projects.""

We should be careful here, especially in light of how Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation recently ended. If Occam's razor is any guide, it's possible that ego and cravenness alone are sufficient to explain Trump's refusal to release his tax returns. But the case is definitely borderline. If there is criminality, it's less likely to come in the form of a grand conspiracy to steal an election than it is to be found in the everyday swindles of a jumped-up used car salesman."	-12

The_Donald	WatashiwaAlice	"I am absolutely not qualified to understand their decision making processes. I am not affiliated with Nintendo. I don't think they've really explained why they banned flags (it wasn't just the transgender flag) originally. Some flags, including the American flag, were also taken down. There seems to be no rhyme or reason. Some ISIS flags also didn't get taken down (at first). Seems a lot like a random pool of submissions, and in that a bunch of people got banned for trans flag, and cried on the internet, and the Nintendo regretted their decision... But idk if that's actually what happened, but that'd be my guess. 

I'm also not entirely sold that transgender flag is inherently political. It can be used as such, and often is, but by itself it seems totally not radical and totally harmless. It seems really bizzare to get banned for it. Mostly likely, people were getting banned for titles like ""support trans rights"" which isn't the same as just the symbology. However, Nintendo, wisely, isn't saying much. It will blow over and wasn't ever news to begin with."	-9

The_Donald	Jabron661	"While a sound ""real world"" strategy, I dont think the undead army has flanks, at least not in the traditional sense.

The undead army is essentially just a giant cluster of puppets who seem to have only two settings, march and then when ordered, charge forward with reckless abandon, since they have no fear. Just a relentless wave of savagery that only thinks to close with that then attack the living.

They use their huge numbers and mass to overwhelm whatever they can get their hands on and rip it apart.

I think only sound defense would have been to use obstacles, fire, trenches etc. Basically anything that would break up the swarming mass of undead and give the human army time to attack at a distance and make the numbers more manageable.

Perhaps the best use of that dothraki light cav would have been to work to get behind the undead and seek the white walkers themselves in the rear, force the undead to commit some troops to watching the rear and thinning the frontal assault as much as possible."	-1

The_Donald	Ghostof_PatrickHenry	"I agree that the battle was frustrating as fuck to watch-- to watch the greatest warriors in the world (Dothraki + Unsullied) get butchered like a bunch  of hogs. But I think that was the point: to establish a sense of desperation and defeat in the minds of the audience and characters witnessing it. (It definitely worked.) Plus, the consideration that the battle commanders-- outside of Jon-- had never engaged the enemy before, and had no idea what to expect. 

I also think it served a story-telling purpose of eliminating the 2 greatest advantages the good guys have against Cersei (assuming dragons still won't be used against castles). It seems clear now that the human v human struggle is more important to the story than the existential battle against the dead. (I assumed it was always the other way, which is a nice surprise.)

to ensure efficiency only citizens who have the degree in a field relating to a policy would be able to vote for it or at least have a much stronger weight to their vote. this would ensure that people with actual tech degrees and knowledge would vote for tech policies and not people who don't understand them.

i understand that such system is not without faults but it would be far better than what most countries have now where there are hundreds of useless idiots with 6 figure salaries twiddling their thumbs passing policies left and right that they have no clue what they're about. just think how much tax money is being wasted on 1000's of such people."	1

They all just seemed to vanish for a while.  I get that they have a budget, but they could have done what they did in prior seasons and just hinted at the greater battle and just show small, closed aspects of the battle.

The_Donald	30RoundMagClip	I do understand why did what they did but I just think it could have been done so much better and have had the same results. The dothraki are based on the mongolians and the unsullied are based on the spartans and they didnt live up to either at all. I think seeing mongolian cavalry tactics such as  feigned flight and then the tactics of the greek phalanx would have been incredible to see. But instead we get a suicidal charge (They didnt even barrage them first) and the worlds weakest most unlocked phalanx. The phalanx in particular was heart breaking as the unsullied have all the training and will to put up a damn strong shield wall but instead we got each line of men fighting alone. The strength of that formation is in each man supporting the one to his front. Of course it leaves your flanks exposed but I dint see the wights attempt any other tactics than a head on charge.

The_Donald	CrystallinePineapple	"Staunch trump supporter here, and not that any of you will listen. What you're doing when you make statements that over defend your position is alienating people (like me) who identify differently from you. Studies consistently find that about 10% of men and about 15% of women have homosexual experiences in this country, which is a lot of people considering the strong sentiment that it's not ""normal."" Please be welcome to feel comfortable as hetero, the world takes all kinds. Both hetero and homosexuality are normal. It's not mutually exclusionary. Please also be inclusive to gender and sexual minorities. These people struggle with feeling accepted. You could say that feelings of acceptance are just that, feelings, and of lesser consideration. Please consider that the driving force behind the message that any sexuality (including hetero) is normal is the desire for someone belonging to that group to feel accepted. That is a basic human need, to feel accepted by a peer group. The Donald wants to have gender and sexual minorities in their peer group and needs to accept them, because we should be uniting on MAGA and not arguing about bedrooms! Stop upvoting topics that don't MAGA."	9

The_Donald	HotelMohelHolidayInn	"On the topic of “good ones” among the general misfit population of third world vigrants in Western nations:

The “good ones” can only exist in a state of peace. For example, when your country is exclusively yours and you visit India and meet your social peer there, with whom you find that you have many interests in common.

But the world is now at war. The “good ones” over here are better at mimicry, the better to rape your land. Sure, one can be polite and cordial in a work environment for example, but they never forget that they are part of a conquering nation and you’re the conquered.

In a reverse-conquest setting a century ago, E.M. Forester’s “A Passage to India” asks whether an Englishman and an Indian can be friends. The answer comes via the Indian doctor’s reply to the liberal Englishman: they cannot be friends until the English leave India.

Power differentials exert the biggest influence on human behavior. We act so much differently when we are riding a high of absolute power than when we are beholden to others and deferential as a matter of survival.

The masses of migrants know in their bones that they storm our homelands a conquering force, and they act like one (with significant help from traitorous homewreckers within the family). They can feel it as surely as White natives can feel their countries slipping away from them. This instinctual assessment of reality on the ground, as opposed to the manufactured fantasyland of diversity & inclusion pushed by an enemy media and their gullible NPCs, is the emotional force multiplier hyper-charging the inter-tribe social dynamics on all levels, and which will, if left to overheat into an asymmetrical war in which the invaders are granted all privileges, alibis, and honors while the natives are stripped of dignity and punished for the affront of defending their own interests, end in the last fig leaf about “good ones” fluttering to the ground as the crisis comes into clarifying view.

It’s a very simple calculation. People either cling to their lunatic mutterings about “good ones” as the parcel of territory your ancestors carved out for their posterity is abandoned to the horde, or you get a grip and put away childish banalities to see the world and human nature as it is, instead of as you wish it."	-11

Biden is not mentally fit for any kind of political office. 

> (CNSNews.com) - Speaking at the White House National Conference on Mental Health on Monday, Vice President Joe Biden told a sometimes serious and sometimes jocular story about the two brain surgeries he needed in 1988 to deal with cranial aneurysms.

>Biden told the White House audience “they take a saw and they cut your head off” and “they literally had to take the top of my head off.” He also recounted that as he was being wheeled into surgery he asked the neurosurgeon, “What are my chances of getting off this table completely normal?” The surgeon told Biden he had a better chance of living—and that that chance was in the 35 to 50 percent range.

>“The only totally un-chartered portion of the universe is the brain,” Biden said in his White House speech. “You know, as we used to say in the Senate, excuse the point of personal privilege here: I had two cranial aneurysms, and they literally had to take the top of my head off. I mean, they take a saw and they cut your head off, and go in to find the artery that is--one was leaking, the other that hadn't, before it burst."	16

After a while, women end up in charge of everything.  But they mostly get there by using their womanly wiles.  Virtue and vice are not over- or under-represented in either sex.

There is a woman who fights like the men, but she is bigger than most of the men and is very clearly an extreme outlier.

And there is a girl who fights like a ninja assassin, but she was trained by a cult of semi-magical ninja assassins, and she gets manhandled pretty badly the first time she gets swarmed and can't kill every attacker one-by-one at spear-length.

I think the biggest problem is that the strategies and tactics are uniformly bad.  Occasionally, this is intentional, like when the producers want to remind everyone that a character ended up in charge of a battle despite having no skill, training or experience at war.  Other times, it is unintentional, like when the producers had literally the most clever characters in the show, plus the most experienced commanders get together and come up with a ""serious"" plan that would make Leeroy Jenkins blush.

The latest episode was both great and disappointing, at the same time.  After two weeks of sitting around talking, this whole episode was fighting.  And the fighting was great.  But...  the good guys ended up in too much danger too soon, forcing the writers to have someone else miraculously save them too many times, and/or to hold out against impossible odds for too long.  And the ending was far too abrupt  And most of the battles happened at night, in a snow storm, so you had no idea what was happening.  Etc, etc.

The TV guys needed to slim that stuff down and keep the story moving. You get stuck with just about all of the main characters getting separated after the purple wedding and all of their arcs only interact with a couple characters here and there. In the books he also keeps introducing more and more characters. Everyone just doing their own stuff in order to wait for Jon to finally get out of his vows and take back the North. The story suffered because of it. In the show we get two weak seasons followed by being thrust into an accelerated end game.	-4

Automaton fits the bill. This is a form of mass hysteria or mass narcissistic delusion. Individual humans have surrendered their personalities and thoughts to the Hivemind, for the dopaminergic tingle of seeing themselves reflected in a million other like-minded simulacra through the ritualistic viewing of dumb escapist fantasy.

This is the effluvia of both globalism and escape from globalism. These benighted creaturas shrieking and jizzing over a Dungeons & Dragons campaign (with less depth) are the unwitting meat nuggets tossed into the Globohomo maw, desperately trying to escape Globohomo though its digestive tract.

And part of the escapist lure of GOT is the nearly all-White leading cast, a welcome respite from the Diversitopia reality, which these bar room lards would never admit was one of the draws of the show for them.

Notice the room is basically 100% White. I am sure that there are various people in there from the Left, the Right, and in the middle. Say what you will about Game of Thrones, including the various POZ scenes and issues, as well as having shitlib producers, but it does show that the European soul has a longing for days of glory gone by, when there were knights, battles of honor, and unified armies fighting against a known, easily identifiable enemy (be that a different race, or even the living dead). The men were men, not sissies. That is why other shows, even with various POZ and historical (generally, pro-feminist) inaccuracies, are very, very popular – like Vikings and Knightfall. It is part of the European soul…a different soul from other races.

Which reminds me: Pop culture has become a touchstone because Americans have so little in common anymore that they must reach for quips and scenes from pozzed TV shows to manufacture fellow-feeling.

Organic community is gone, so Pedowood invented an inorganic community to replace it.

Which was the plan all along.

Millions of Americans orgasm over waif assassins and costumed superheroes as their nations fall one by one to the logic of the locust swarm.

The_Donald	ColonelHanson	"Of course he may believe that banning weapons would reduce violent crime. Those who ban firearms tend to believe that. There are very few people who ban firearms with the notion of subjecting the population to their tyranny in mind. 

The problem is, that once the populace has been disarmed, the capacity for tyranny grows exponentially. I believe it was Thomas Jefferson who said something along the lines of “ so long as the populace is armed the government won’t even think to tyrannically oppress its people”. 

If you want to fix major violent crime, you have to fix the underlying cause, not just the mechanism used to inflict that crime. If the existence and availability of firearms was the driver of violent crime we would expect to see violent crime be extremely high when the ability to obtain a firearm very easy. This was the case in the United States from the 30s until the 60s and 70s, (an individual could walk into a store and get a semi automatic weapon without a background check) in that time violent crime rate was quite low and we did not have a rash of mass shootings. 

Furthermore, if gun ownership rates dry violent crime then there is no way to explain how it’s as gun ownership rates have increased violent crime has decreased. 

Lastly, those who try to ban firearms seem to perpetually not understand that those who are going to commit violent crime don’t give a damn about the law. The only people who care about the law and will abide by it are those who do not want to commit a violent crime. 93% of all violent crimes with a firearm, are committed using a firearm that was illegally obtained. 

————————————-

Problem the left runs into is that when they in act firearm controls they are living in a state of relative peace. They assume that a stable democracy is a natural state of things when it is not. A nation state is always on the knifes edge of failure. The cohesion of the state and the balance of power between the government and its people are always at a tipping point that can lead to the collapse and failure of that nation state. 

If you want proof of this, ask the Jews in Germany, ask the Tatar’s Chechens Greeks balkyars and kalmyks in The Soviet Union, ask those who tried to rise against the Chinese Communist Party in 1989 and will run over with tanks in Tienamen square.

The_Donald	Head_Cockswain	"> When you're in jail, you're not part of society anymore.

This is the crux of the matter.  That is the purpose of prison.  To remove a purpose from society, so that someone who proves themselves a danger/threat to others has no access or influence over others, and voting is certainly that.

Rehabilitation is another discussion, as it is a possible side-effect or secondary to the idea of prison. Even ""Punishment"" is part of that.

Prison is not about vengeance, or some social justice.  It is about making sure an unfit person has no influence, no opportunity, to do what they've proven willing and capable of doing.

""Just"" in justice sets out to correct an ""injustice"", which is an innocent person being harmed by another person.  This is the underpinning of much of civilization, including the ""justice"" system.

If you want to branch into other things such as rehabilitation, then you have to branch into various laws that people end up breaking to wind up there, and the legal system at large.  EG:  ""People shouldn't be in prison for X, Y, or Z.""

In that case, fighting for the right for all felons to vote is the wrong fight.  They should be fighting for exactly that: ""People shouldn't be in prison for X, Y, or Z.""

Otherwise, if we're talking about truly inalienable rights, they're all equivalent, and it becomes an anti- jail/prison argument.  I think this is where the far left reveals their anarchist nature, the dark side of being liberal to an extreme.

Time and again they fall on the side of the criminal.  EG in cases of self defense, the left almost always comes down on what normal society sees as the original victim.  Through almost all discussions, if we know nothing of the politics of those involved, the left/far-left almost always falls on the side of the one originally doing wrong to someone else(as a vast majority of sane society would see it)."	-8

The_Donald	oldchangeling	"Heh. Maybe I can! It is a bribery mechanism, but not new. I remember first hearing how these things work from a Harold Robbins novel decades ago. I can't be sure (and am definitely not going to go back and read those things to find out), but I think it might have been ""The Carpetbaggers"", published in  1961. 

The trick back then was a publisher paying a politician for a book of ""collected speeches"" cut from the Congressional Record. As you probably know, any rep can put literally anything into the Congressional Record. They can show up in the middle of the night and read nursery rhymes if they want. The books would then be printed and sold to, say, a trade union which would stash them in  warehouse or have them all shredded.

Robbins described this whole scam in detail, and it always stuck with me because it's so vile and yet flawless. A total waste, yes, but criminals don't care about that. You can't stop it. It's a perfectly legal way for anyone to put cash into a pol's pocket."	-4

The_Donald	IShouldNotTalk	 I agree the battle plan in the show was shit, but there were more soldiers/warriors than could conceivably fight in the castle effectively. Besides the castle is a fall back of last resort in any siege, once you're bottled up in a space that an enemy can surround it's extremely difficult to break out without taking massive casualties, and that's when fighting an actual army in reality. In the show, they are fighting an enemy that has no need for sleep, never fatigues, never need logistical resupply, has no fear of taking casualties and is reinforced almost instantaneously. The castle is just a trap you've put yourself in at that point.	-11

The_Donald	In_The_ReDzONE	I get the point you're making, but the study is about voting *from prison*.  I do not think that **anyone** should be allowed to cast a vote from prison while serving a prison sentence.  This should be part of the sentence.  Now, I think we have plenty of room for civil discourse over what happens when someone's sentence ends and they are free.  I am not necessarily opposed to some classes of felons to be able to regain certain rights after they serve their sentence.  For instance, if someone served 10 years for financial crimes, or non-violent felony offenses (including drug trafficking, etc.), and they are released from prison, I am not opposed for them to have a procedure to go through to restore voting rights/privileges.  Let me reiterate that no one should ever be allowed to vote from prison, at least in my opinion.	-8

The_Donald	leing15	"Well, Muslims aren't used to logic.

Islam actually teaches that Adam (the very first man) was the first Muslim and every prophet since and including Abraham was a Muslim (like Jesus also was) preaching Islam.

I know that religion is a matter of faith and doesn't have to make ""Earthly"" sense, but we are also talking about historical facts here. 

There is no record of Islam existing or of anyone being referred to as a Muslim until the thief, rapist, pedophile, murderer con-man, Muhammad, made it all up in the 7th century and it is well known that all of the prophets and Jesus were all Jews.

Obviously, we all it makes no sense to believe that Adam and every prophet, including Jesus, was a Muslim but Muslims don't care because ""muh Muhammad said so.""

I have debated this (and many other idiocies of Islam) with Muslims (mainly on YouTube), and not a single one has been able to answer my questions about this subject (or the other subjects I bring up), but the fact they have no idea how to explain any of it makes no difference to them whatsoever. Again, I'm not talking about questions of faith, but questions involving history and common sense that don't involve the faith aspect.

Muhammad filled the Quran with self-serving ""revelations"" because every time he needed something, he made up that Allah revealed to him something that would satisfy him personally.  A great example is the supposed ""DIVINE revelation"", directly from Allah, saying that people should only go to Muhammad's house when invited and, when doing so for dinner, should only arrive when the meal was already ready to serve and should leave right after finishing the meal.  THIS is actually in the Quran, but WHY?

Why would God find it necessary for the enlightenment of the human race, for eternity, to make a ""divine revelation"" just to let everyone know that they aren't supposed to hang out at Muhammad's house before and/or after dinner?

This is very obvious one (among many) of Muhammad's self-serving ""revelations"".  He probably had to had both ""business"" and familial gatherings but he didn't want anyone to bug him before or after the meal they were invited for, which is understandable since he had up to 11 wives' beds to choose from and sex slaves to abuse. Rather than tell people that he had better things to do than waste time with them, he made up a ""revelation"" from Allah.

&nbsp;

Here is the verse: Quran Surah 33, verse 53 (Translation from The Clear Quran, Dr. Mustafa Khattab)

*O believers! **Do not enter the homes of the Prophet without permission ˹and if invited˺ for a meal, do not ˹come too early and˺ linger until the meal is ready.** But if you are invited, then enter ˹on time˺. **Once you have eaten, then go on your way, and do not stay for casual talk. Such behaviour is truly annoying to the Prophet, yet he is too shy to ask you to leave.** But Allah is never shy of the truth. And when you ˹believers˺ ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and theirs. **And it is not right for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever marry his wives after him. This would certainly be a major offence in the sight of Allah.***

How stupid does anyone have to be not to see through this stupid ""revelation"" and to believe that God found it important enough to put in his ""divine guide to humanity"" that no one should stay longer than necessary at Muhammad's house and annoy him, shouldn't get near his wives, and shouldn't marry them after he discards them to marry new ones?"	-9

The_Donald	HotelMohelHolidayInn	"Of course, in a relentlessly pozzed show like Gayme of Drones, a waifish girl dispatches dozens of grown men.

I wish I had talent to accurately depict how much I despise, how much I loathe the bugman, the clown world in all its manifestations. But I cannot. It is visceral, it goes beyond words, far beyond rational, far beyond the repulsiveness as we knew it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?)v=n5wm3fY5pCY

Automaton fits the bill. This is a form of mass hysteria or mass narcissistic delusion. Individual humans have surrendered their personalities and thoughts to the Hivemind, for the dopaminergic tingle of seeing themselves reflected in a million other like-minded simulacra through the ritualistic viewing of dumb escapist fantasy.

This is the effluvia of both globalism and escape from globalism. These benighted creaturas shrieking and jizzing over a Dungeons & Dragons campaign (with less depth) are the unwitting meat nuggets tossed into the Globohomo maw, desperately trying to escape Globohomo though its digestive tract.

And part of the escapist lure of GOT is the nearly all-White leading cast, a welcome respite from the Diversitopia reality, which these bar room lards would never admit was one of the draws of the show for them.

Notice the room is basically 100% White. I am sure that there are various people in there from the Left, the Right, and in the middle. Say what you will about Game of Thrones, including the various POZ scenes and issues, as well as having shitlib producers, but it does show that the European soul has a longing for days of glory gone by, when there were knights, battles of honor, and unified armies fighting against a known, easily identifiable enemy (be that a different race, or even the living dead). The men were men, not sissies. That is why other shows, even with various POZ and historical (generally, pro-feminist) inaccuracies, are very, very popular – like Vikings and Knightfall. It is part of the European soul…a different soul from other races.

Which reminds me: Pop culture has become a touchstone because Americans have so little in common anymore that they must reach for quips and scenes from pozzed TV shows to manufacture fellow-feeling.

Organic community is gone, so Pedowood invented an inorganic community to replace it.

Which was the plan all along.

Millions of Americans orgasm over waif assassins and costumed superheroes as their nations fall one by one to the logic of the locust swarm.

We have relatively good lives. It’s a decent time to be alive. So we invent issues to complain about. For most of *us*,it’s being irritated that the internet takes too long to load, or my damn coffee that’s always fucked up. Even if we don’t outwardly complain or make a big deal, these are the “hardships” that populate our lives.

Liberals though, find a way to take this to a societal level. They’re mad that their shitty decisions didn’t work out (such as getting a gender studies degree). They realize that they essentially paid (or will pay via loans) for *nothing.* They feel offended that being a gender studies degree holder gets nothing whatsoever in the long wrong. So naturally, it *must* mean that something is wrong with the entire system. It’s sad really. I can’t imagine my whole life being a series of blaming successful people for my lack of success.

Far too often I see people on here try to respond with ""yeah but the Christians were just defending themselves against Muslims you see"". There is truth to that, but it is also true that some very evil things were done by Christians during the Crusades that went far beyond playing defense. 

Never fall into the trap of arguing that Christians were/are always the good guys. To believe that Christians were always the good guys is one of the most anti-Christian things you can say. We are all sinners. We are all tempted by and capable of choosing evil. The difference is that Christians follow a theology that condemns all of that evil, whereas Muslims follow a theology that seeks to justify it."	3

I think they made the girls a bit of wish fulfillment in the later seasons, they don't have any flaws anymore and nothing ever goes wrong for them. They're just not interesting anymore.

This statement, and this statement:

> I'm pro death penalty on certain types of violent felons. 

Are totally at odds with each other.

&#x200B;

I think you would agree with the following, but you didn't state it that way:

1. Part of the purpose of punishment is to prevent offenders from repeating offenses against other innocent parties.  We put arsonists in jail so they cannot set more buildings on fire.  Giving them a second chance at society is secondary, and comes later, the immediate problem is that the behavior MUST NOT continue.
   1. This is where the argument of not jailing marijuana offenders comes from, by the way.  I have no horse in that race, but will say only some small percent of marijuana related offenders in the jail system are convicted solely of possession/use.  Usually other crime is involved, or at least sale/distribution.
2. Justice comes from equitable punishment.  If you steal $5,000 from me, you owe me $5,000.  If you kill me, you owe me... what?  You deprived me of life, you deserve to also be deprived of life.  This is the basis of the death penalty (which you support).  It does not mean that the punishment is ""vengeance"", it is ""justice"".
3. If you prove to be incapable of playing by the rules that everybody else has agreed upon, you forfeit your voice in determining the rules, this is just.  We can debate what constitutes a felony all day, and that will be a healthy debate, but the basic idea should be agreed upon as sound.  It would be more fair to not allow you to vote only on issues related to your crime, but our republican system does not allow for such controls."	-14
The_Donald	In_The_ReDzONE	"""id rather **citizens** be able to vote than to look and scour for w/e nitpick we can to deny them rights and libertys""

When a prisoner is serving a prison sentence after being convicted of a felony, that prisoner no longer has the fundamental right of freedom of movement.  They no longer have the fundamental right of freedom to procreate.  They no longer have many fundamental rights.  They no longer have liberty.  They are serving a prison sentence for a felony conviction.  Acting like they have rights and liberties after being convicted of a felony is absurd.  They have been convicted - either by a jury of their peers or upon a deal with the government.  Either way, they were convicted.  You want to talk about what constitutes a felony?  Fair game.  You want to talk about a procedure for felons who have completed their prison sentence?  Fair game.  You want to try and tell me a prisoner serving a prison sentence for a felony conviction should be able to vote?  You are outta your mind.  We ARE denying these felons their rights and liberties, because they necessarily denied rights and liberties to their VICTIMS."	-30

The_Donald	Rap3DBac0N	"Our families 2015 family reunion hats were red with white lettering.  I guess from a distance they look like ""MAGA"" hats?  Anyway, story time...

I was driving in town about 3 weeks ago and pulled up to a stop light behind this lady.  When I stopped, I looked and noticed she was maybe dancing(?) in her seat, waving her hands around all crazy like... then she stuck her head out the window and looked back at me, quickly went back in the window and gave the finger.   When the light turned green, she sped off like Mario Andretti.  I didn't think much of it honestly, just that she was some crazy chick... who knew?

Unfortunately, I met up with her at the next light, me in the left lane and her in the right.  I actually didn't even notice it was the same chick, until she started honking and screaming at me.  I rolled my window down and asked her if there was a problem.  I was promptly told that I could go have sex with myself, and that my mother was apparently a woman of the evening. 

She then told me I was racist because of my hat.  My hat?  I asked her what hat she was referring to.. and she said ""That fucking red MAGA hat!"".  I picked up my family reunion hat and showed it to her (it was on my dashboard), and asked her if it was the one.  She said yes.  I turned it around and explained to her it was my family reunion hat.  Her face went dead for a moment.. and then like a light switch, she started screaming again, ""Yeah, well, fuck your family reunion!"" and ran a red light turning right.

Luckily there was a cop right there that saw it, and immediately pulled her over.  I also noticed she didn't even have a license plate on her car.   I hope that kind lady gets the help she deserves."	-13

You again are stating you can’t imagine there’s a God because you can’t imagine an ideal world. You can’t imagine an ideal world because you don’t live in one. You may understand the idea of religion, but you seem to be unable to conceptualize anything beyond what you see and hear in your day to day life. I’d be curious what you thought of things that exist outside the laws of physics, such as wormholes. I’d wager you probably don’t give things like that much thought, but that’s just a guess. What I know for sure is you have difficulties conceptualizing outside the box. I am sure this comes off as an insult (how else could such a thing be taken), but I don’t mean to insult you.

The_Donald	Disquestrian	The coup is actually against black hat CIA Blackwater (puppet Maduro), which had beaten controlling Venezuela for decades.  Deep State/K'baal going down everywhere.	-2
The_Donald	1320Fastback	"If there is one thing I know about polls it's that Hillary has a 92% chance of winning. 

REEEEEEEE!!!!!!!"	2
The_Donald	ishtaria_Esdeath	My mother and sister both still wear those one piece swimsuits because they prefer modesty. So you're not wrong. Nothing wrong with modesty. It's admirable in fact. Granted, the reason for the modesty of the woman on the left is because she'd be in physical danger if she wasn't, but that's beside the point	-4

The_Donald	GeneticsGuy	Ya, did the Dothraki not have dragon glass weapons as well? I get the show was trying to make the point at how daunting and powerful the undead army was, for what they did to the Dothraki, but them leading a calvary charge at the very beginning is a horrible strategy.	-1
The_Donald	Captain_Resist	Ancient rome was big on butt games though. Also chances are if you are Italian particularly if you look ethnic you have more in common with Turks or Arabs than with the ancestors that were in Italy at the time of the Romans.	3
The_Donald	jhsevEN	One thing I am noticing is they will give anyone a blue check mark these days. I swear, 90% of the time I see a blue check mark it is someone I've never heard of in my life.	0
The_Donald	Supports45-	thats what i was thinking, only venezuelans dont have a holy allegiance to terrorism and they sure as shit wont be voting democrat ever.	-4
The_Donald	hivemindblown	The cache of wildfire is in King's landing, along with the guild of people who know how to make it. There's no chance that Cersei would let them have it.	1

The_Donald	lax714	He's disgusting... closing his eyes as he creates his sexual fantasy.	0
The_Donald	GulleyFoyleIsMyName	I didn't look like she was running away. As soon as One eyed flaming sword guy (Barian?) fulfilled his destiny I KNEW it would be Arya killing the icy bastard. The Red Bitch's dialog with Arya ruined any surprise there. That was for folks that didn't remember all the gooey details. These things are written for the casual fan not for the GOT scholars.	2

That's how you defeat white power symbols.

But you have to be quick. Otherwise the nazis give you a dead arm."	-5
The_Donald	magamix	As long as you have a job and have money to pay the extortionist left, you won't be free to go. They still need revenue to put into their cronies' pockets and to pipe it to the welfare leeches and illegals. Only the total useless leeches on society get the free pass.	-1
The_Donald	soldio101	The entire fabrication of his fantasy world is a plot device to sell shitty stories, well written shitty stories but shitty non the less.  The TV show is noting but fan service at this point.	-6
The_Donald	soksniffer	"What a lame article and the headline is bogus.  I'm curious what the ""Arabic"" writing says... is it really Arabic?  It could be gibberish for all the article seems to know!

Edit: It says ""Mohammed Jihad"""	-1
The_Donald	-REEEEEEEDACTED-	"That and his completely made-up FAKE ""conflict"" with Mike Pence, who has never ever said anything demeaning about Buttplug, and in fact sang his praise several times when he did comment on the man. But now that the faggot is running for office he has to out-victim the other ""victims"" running like Booker and Harris. 

What a fucking snake."	-3
The_Donald	ishtaria_Esdeath	Not quite the most damaging race hoax. The most damaging is the delusion that persists to this day that the Civil War was over slavery. The south still catches flak over that historical fallacy and will indefinitely.	0
